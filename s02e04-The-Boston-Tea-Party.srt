00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello and welcome to revolutions.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,640
Episode 20, The Boston Tea Party.

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,850
In the seven years since the end of the French and Indian War, relations between Britain

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,080
and her colonies had gone through a few cycles of depressing antagonism.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,190
Neither side really understanding what the other was up to or why.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,100
But now that the fervor over the towns and axe was subsiding, both Britain and America

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,630
looked forward to the return of productive and profitable normalcy.

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,970
And for almost two years, it looked like the chaotic hostility of the 1760s would be

9
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,620
contained to the 1760s.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
Parliament made no further provocative moves.

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,940
The radical colonial leaders went into political eclipse and British goods started

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,210
flowing back into the colonies in larger quantities than ever.

13
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,870
But the peace and prosperity would not last.

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,060
The first clue that neither side was done and hanging, rising, the other came in June

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,060
1772 when a customs ship called the Gas B ran aground while chasing suspected smugglers

16
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,200
off the coast of Rhode Island.

17
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,960
A local mob quickly descended on the beach.

18
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,960
Chip took it over by force and burned it.

19
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,000
Parliament was, of course, outraged and formed a commission to investigate the affair.

20
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,620
But this commission was stonewalled and blamed never could be properly assessed.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,900
But informing the commission, parliament revealed that it still had a tin ear when it

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,370
came to colonial politics.

23
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,430
Because had anyone in Rhode Island been found culpable?

24
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,900
The commissioners were empowered to drag them back to Britain for trial, which to the

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,180
colonists made a mockery of the whole right to be tried by a jury of your peers thing.

26
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,950
You know, one of the bedrocks of English liberty.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,250
Then over the summer, attentions in neighboring Massachusetts started to rise again over

28
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,460
the lingering issue of how to pay for the royal administration.

29
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,640
Though the Townsend duties had been mostly repealed, the right to pay the governor had

30
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,160
not been returned to the Massachusetts Assembly, and the remaining duty on tea now paid

31
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,030
Gov. Thomas Hutchinson salary in mid 1770 to the ministry, started making noises that

32
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,370
they wanted to extend this policy to include all the judges as well as swallowing the

33
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,080
governor's salary had been tough.

34
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,060
But the thought of the judiciary becoming a mere tool of the crown was too much to bear.

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,000
And committees of correspondence began to reappear in January 1773.

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,380
Governor Hutchinson then added fuel to the fire when he bluntly announced that the

37
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,090
committees were way out of line.

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,350
Parliament's authority was supreme, always had been and always would be.

39
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:56,320
And then he said no line can be drawn between the supreme authority of Parliament and the

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,690
total independence of the colonies.

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,780
His assumption here was that independence was so unthinkable that the answer must be

42
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,130
Parliament is in charge.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,590
But unfortunately, that did not turn out to be an assumption that everyone shared.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,590
But the real end to the uneasy calm that had prevailed in the colony since 1770 came in

45
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:27,900
May 1773 when parliament passed the Tea Act, the Tea Act has nothing to do with the duty

46
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,000
on tea left over from the towns and acts.

47
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,510
Now this is a whole new piece of tea based obnoxiousness.

48
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,030
The issue Parliament was trying to address is when I briefly mentioned last week the East

49
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,040
India Company was in a deplorable state of financial disrepair and needed a bailout.

50
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,950
Now, put simply, the East India Company was a private corporation that held a legal

51
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,170
monopoly on trade with India and China.

52
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,450
It had been chartered back in 16:00, was owned by a collection of rich traders and

53
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,100
well-connected aristocrats, and was, at this point in history, so corrupt and mismanaged

54
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,330
that it was about to implode.

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,010
Now, I'm going to oversimplify all of this so we don't have to talk about the crushingly

56
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,710
boring details of how T auctions work in London.

57
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,720
But the upshot of it all was that the Tea Act allowed the company to start importing its

58
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,700
tea directly into the colonies.

59
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,750
The point was to both find an outlet for the huge stockpiles of tea.

60
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,760
The company had accidentally built up and plug them into a stable new revenue stream.

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,490
The Tea Act looked like a pretty good deal to parliament, one that they hoped would go

62
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,470
over well in the colonies, where retail customers would now be able to buy tea at cut

63
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,280
rate prices. The only pushback was supposed to come from the few colonial middlemen who

64
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,480
made a living importing tea from London and of course, the smugglers who made a living

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,670
sneaking in duty free tea from the Netherlands.

66
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,220
But who cares about them? As it turned out, though, rage over the Tea Act was, as usual,

67
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,370
far more widespread than anyone in Parliament anticipated.

68
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,020
Things got off on the wrong foot right away when it was mistakenly rumoured that the

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,150
company tea would be exempt from Townsend tea duty, which, had it been true, would have

70
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,190
been quite a poke in the eye to the colonists.

71
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,230
But the real fear was that the company tea was just the beginning, and that if it all

72
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,460
worked out that soon other British companies would be allowed to sell directly into the

73
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,050
colonies too. And this might temporarily be good for the consumer, but it would be

74
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,610
devastating to the independent colonial economy and in effect, reduce them all to a bunch

75
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,140
of manual laborers producing raw materials for the home country and nothing more.

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,850
Into this. Governor Hutchinson once again added fuel to the fire, though, in his defense.

77
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,010
These letters were supposed to have been secret.

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,520
Back in the late 1760s, Hutchinson and a few conservative allies in Boston had written a

79
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,630
series of letters to a sub minister back in Britain 1772.

80
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,280
These letters were passed by some anonymous agent to Benjamin Franklin, who sent them

81
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,600
along to a friend back home.

82
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,820
They were supposed to remain under wraps, but after Franklin's friend sat on them for six

83
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,460
months, he agreed with Samuel Adams that it was too good of a hand not to play because

84
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,320
Wynne published these letters confirm the most paranoid radical fantasies about a

85
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,410
conspiracy to extinguish English liberty in the colonies.

86
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,930
Because Hutchinson explicitly recommends that the ministry suspend certain liberties in

87
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,620
the colonies. As the autumn of 1773 approached, opposition to the Tea Act spread up and

88
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,330
down the colonies, though this time the merchants of Philadelphia, far from dragging

89
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,280
their feet, led the way they were led by the credible voice of John Dickinson, who

90
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,370
remained for now on the leading edge of radical resistance, with seventy carrying ships

91
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,250
bound for Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Charleston already long.

92
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,970
The resurgent radical swore to stop the tea from being off loaded.

93
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,730
Now, this is probably a good time to point out that though there was a healthy public

94
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,750
consensus about this, there were definitely men and women who wanted nothing to do with

95
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,940
all of these non importation schemes.

96
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,800
Some because it hurt their bottom line, some because they were politically sympathetic to

97
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,300
parliament's claim of authority and some because they know less than the radicals just

98
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,220
didn't like being told what to do.

99
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,200
So when it came to making sure these various non importation and non consumption

100
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,010
agreements worked. Enforcement mechanisms were required.

101
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,050
The most basic tool of enforcement was social and economic isolation.

102
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,970
Names of merchants who defied the import bans were published in the papers and boycotts

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,160
of their businesses encouraged the incident just before the Boston massacre, for example,

104
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,930
the one when the kid got killed was started when enforcers hung an importer sign above a

105
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,080
man's house and a sympathetic neighbor tried to take it down.

106
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,320
But if social and economic coercion weren't enough, physical coercion was next up up to

107
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,090
and including the old tar and feathering routine, which was quite a bit more vicious a

108
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,600
practice than you might think.

109
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,790
To the more conservative merchants, the ones who will wind up loyalists when the war

110
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,430
breaks out. The hypocrisy of all this was galling.

111
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,720
I mean, how can you claim to be a defender of liberty when you won't even let me conduct

112
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,730
my business as I see fit?

113
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,080
But of course, there was a bigger picture to consider.

114
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,820
And since we're already wandering away from the story, this seems like a pretty good time

115
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,570
to peel off and consider the psychological framework within which the colonists were

116
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,150
operating. Try to understand why the ministry's policies the Stamp Act in the towns and

117
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,910
ACT and now the Tea Act were provoking so much resistance resistance that you might think

118
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,620
is just a wee bit out of proportion to the relatively light tax increases they

119
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:53,030
represented. So for this I'll be drawing from an absolute must read if you're into the

120
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,050
Revolution. The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution by Bernard Beilein.

121
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,450
I can only give you a superficial sketch of his argument here.

122
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,740
So if you're interested, I would encourage you to pick it up, because as it turns out,

123
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,540
the colonists were drawing from a very specific set of principles to help them interpret

124
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,630
the ministry's actions in the worst possible light.

125
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,640
After reviewing the contemporary political literature, that is all the pamphlets that

126
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,890
were flying off the presses, Balen identified five basic foundations for the American

127
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,210
argument against Parliament.

128
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,480
First, there was antiquity, mostly the example of Republican Rome and the fight against

129
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,790
the tyranny of the Caesars.

130
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,160
But Balen argues that while references to the ancient world are uniformly present, they

131
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,520
are also uniformly superficial and act more as rhetorical window dressing than anything

132
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,530
else. Second were the Enlightenment philosophers, most especially John Locke.

133
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,140
But those references are similarly superficial, with Locke in particular appealed to as a

134
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,880
universal authority trotted out to lend credibility to arguments that he never actually

135
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,210
made. Third were appeals to English Common Law, which had more weight and force behind

136
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,780
them and did solidly route the revolution in the British tradition.

137
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,110
Fourth was a dose of Puritan theology which infused the movement with a providential

138
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,790
sense of destiny that America truly had a special role to play in God's grand design.

139
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,680
But the Fifth Foundation, the one that tied the rest of it together, turns out to be a

140
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,210
collection of fringe politicians from the early seventeen hundreds who represented the,

141
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,380
quote, country party that was opposed to the, quote, Korte party.

142
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,570
These guys believed that history was little more than a running battle between power and

143
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,950
liberty. And they deployed this theory, most especially against their great enemy, Sir

144
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,900
Robert Walpole, who, as I mentioned, is regarded as the first prime minister and who

145
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,890
utterly dominated the British government from the seventeen twenties to the seventeen

146
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:02,250
forties. The specific way Walpole Consolidated Power, three patronage network that bound

147
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,470
men politically and financially to the crown, which our fringe theory saw as the utter

148
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,990
debasement and corruption of English liberty, and which our colonists kind of see

149
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,400
happening in their backyard.

150
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,970
But though these country party ideas never caught on at home, their tracks were widely

151
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,590
printed in the colonies and wound up taking deep root in the American political psyche,

152
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,920
which was from then on, always on guard against powers, endless attempt to subvert

153
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:38,840
liberty. So all the recent moves by Parliament taxes levied without representation.

154
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,580
The influx of new customs agents, the push to free colonial governors from the local

155
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,900
assemblies, the standing armies out on the western frontier and in the streets of Boston,

156
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,020
an attempt to set up a government backed trade monopoly.

157
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,730
This did not look to the colonists like a government honestly trying to deal with the

158
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,290
intricate problems of empire.

159
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,720
It looked like a genuine conspiracy to secure the final triumph of power over liberty in

160
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,080
the colonies and turn Americans into slaves.

161
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,750
But getting back to our story, Massachussets was actually lagging a bit behind on the

162
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,860
issue of the tea tax because Samuel Adams was too busy trying to destroy Thomas

163
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,590
Hutchinson to notice what was going on in the rest of the world.

164
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,270
But that said, when it came down to it, Boston once again took center stage in the

165
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:30,220
dramatic confrontations that accompanied the arrival of company tea in the colonies.

166
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:37,840
On November the twenty eighth, 1773, a merchant ship called the Dartmouth arrived in

167
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,770
Boston carrying, among other things, tea from the East India Company.

168
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,320
The Dartmouth was supposed to offload its cargo, take on some whale oil and then sail

169
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,270
away. But the Sons of Liberty were not going to let the tea off of the ship.

170
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,480
Over the next two days, there were huge public meetings in Boston with upwards of 5000 in

171
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,360
attendance. Under no circumstances was the Dartmouth to do anything but turn around and

172
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,830
take the tea back to Britain.

173
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,940
The ship was put under constant surveillance to make sure that happened.

174
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,140
Now you've got a feel for the poor owner of the ship.

175
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,910
An American, by the way, because he had loaded the T long before Boston decided they

176
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,370
weren't going to take it. Anxious to not have his cargo or, God forbid, his ship

177
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,380
destroyed. The owner requested permission from Hutchinson to leave, but Hutchinson

178
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,770
refused the request, saying the Dartmouth hadn't cleared customs yet.

179
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,120
And of course, the only way to clear customs is offload the cargo.

180
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,980
So, yeah, you gotta feel bad for this guy because the poor dude is just stuck.

181
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,240
I mean, he's perfectly willing to do anything anybody want.

182
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,080
Not to be caught in the middle of all this.

183
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,790
And both sides are telling him now we've decided you are the middle of this.

184
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,600
From the minute the Dartmouth dog.

185
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,200
The clock was ticking because the law further stipulated that if a ship remained in port

186
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,370
for 20 days without paying customs, that it would be seized by the customs agents and you

187
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,650
guessed it, have their cargo offloaded.

188
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,480
So everyone knew that when the 20 days wound up, something was going to happen.

189
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,770
Then just to make things more interesting, in the meantime, two additional ships carrying

190
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,090
Company T arrived.

191
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,980
When December the 16th, 1773, rolled around and the Dartmouth still hadn't offloaded her

192
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,230
cargo. Another public meeting was convened during this meeting.

193
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,430
Samuel Adams delivered his famous line about there being nothing more they could do to

194
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,080
save their country, which was supposed to be the signal for pre-selected members of the

195
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,910
Sons of Liberty to go dump the tea.

196
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,070
But it appears that that story, while not exactly apocryphal, is a little too neat and

197
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,690
tidy regardless.

198
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,730
The assembled crowd was soon marching down to the docks, where they cheered on the

199
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,770
somewhere between 50 and 100 men.

200
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,810
A handful of whom had donned Indian dress, who boarded all three tea bearing ships and

201
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,420
methodically dumped ninety thousand pounds of tea into the harbor.

202
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,950
As usual, this was a disciplined operation.

203
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,170
No other cargo was damaged and in a civilized touch when a padlock belonging to one of

204
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,160
the captains was broken, he found a new one delivered to him a few days later.

205
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,860
When word of the incident, now charmingly known as the Boston Tea Party reached Britain

206
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,680
in January, the ministry went into apoplectic convulsions with Lord North announcing that

207
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,530
this was no longer a fight about taxes, but, quote, whether we have or not any authority

208
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,990
in that country. They call Benjamin Franklin to appear before the Privy Council two days

209
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,170
later to explain the actions of the man he officially represented.

210
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,870
Franklin, as always, was prepared to do so.

211
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,610
But his interview with the Privy Council turned out to be a rage fuelled ambush.

212
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,500
Franklin, as I mentioned, was easily the most respected and influential American.

213
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,490
And with the ministry preparing to lay heavy reprisals on Massachusetts.

214
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,050
They thought it would be a good idea to demolish the credibility of Franklin so he would

215
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:09,690
be neutralized politically if he tried to rally support for his countrymen for an hour.

216
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,430
Franklin was berated in terms so severe that much of what was said was not even written

217
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,650
down. Most of this berating was over his dishonorable conduct in the scandal over

218
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,670
Hutchinson's letters.

219
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,860
Franklin, recognizing that he couldn't win, remained silent and simply laughed when the

220
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,750
ministers had blown all their gas.

221
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,910
Now, up until now, Franklin had been a proud and longstanding defender of the British

222
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,970
Empire, even if he disagreed with this or that policy.

223
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,770
From here on out, though, he will join Hutchinson in the belief that there was no longer

224
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,740
any middle ground. Either Parliament was supreme or the colonies must be independent, and

225
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,590
you can guess which one he now thought preferable.

226
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:58,350
The heavy reprisals the ministry had planned were delivered between March and May 1774 in

227
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,850
a set of four or five related bills that were called the Coercive Acts in Britain, but

228
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,240
which were quickly dubbed in America the Intolerable Acts.

229
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,280
The first was the Boston port bill, which closed the city to all trade but for a few

230
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,570
tightly controlled essentials.

231
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,400
The blockade would start June 15th and continue until the East India Company was

232
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,970
reimbursed for the Dump T, which was valued at about ten thousand pounds.

233
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,190
The second was the Massachusetts Regulatory Act, which more or less abolished

234
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,900
self-government in Massachusetts, making all offices governor appointed and severely

235
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,460
limiting legislative assemblies.

236
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,890
This was coupled with the Administration of Justice Act, which removed from local

237
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,210
jurisdiction any crimes committed by royal officials who would now be tried either in

238
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,030
another colony or, better yet, back in Britain.

239
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,700
The last of these strictly punitive measures was the Quartering Act, which gave far

240
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,670
greater power to the army when it came to securing lodgings.

241
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,870
A problem as we saw they ran into during the fight over the towns and acts.

242
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,720
And last, we have a bill that was passed at the same time and often gets lumped in with

243
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,930
the intolerable acts, but was disconnected from the rest.

244
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,820
And this was the Quip Back Act, which extended the territory of the province of Quebec on

245
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,890
a line running south west, effectively cutting off any claims the colonies had to land

246
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,930
west of the proclamation line, which was offensive both for obvious economic reasons and

247
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:27,830
for more emotional religious reasons because Quebec was Catholic.

248
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,270
If anyone still felt like missing the point about what was going on in Massachusetts on

249
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:40,210
May the 13th, a new governor showed up to replace Hutchinson General Thomas Gage, who had

250
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,430
served since 1763 as commander in chief of all British forces in North America.

251
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:51,130
Massachusetts was now, for all intents and purposes, under military occupation.

252
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,240
News of the Intolerable Act hit the rest of the colonies as a divisive bombshell, with

253
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,010
radicals demanding solidarity with their oppressed brothers and conservatives refusing to

254
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,650
get dragged down by the lunatics up in Boston.

255
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,240
But as the various colonies hashed out how best to respond to the crisis in

256
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,620
Massachusetts, they all started coming to the same conclusion that the colonies ought to

257
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,690
get together and talk about it collectively.

258
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,360
Radicals believed such an assembly would allow them to forge a powerful and united front

259
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,010
to oppose parliament's tyranny, while conservatives believed that by elevating the debate

260
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,760
to a higher plane that cooler heads would prevail.

261
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,800
Over the summer of 1774, the colonies each in their own way, selected delegates to meet

262
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,480
in Philadelphia in September.

263
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,670
The only colony not to send a delegation was Georgia, who, reeling from an uprising of

264
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,610
Creek Indians, would have gladly accepted all the troops.

265
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,430
Boston was trying to get rid of on September the 5th, 1774.

266
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,660
Fifty six men representing 12 colonies met in Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia and

267
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,730
convened the first continental Congress as they began their session.

268
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,160
The Massachusetts delegation, which included both Sam and John Adams, made a concerted

269
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,660
effort to hold back.

270
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,600
They understood that it was kind of their fault.

271
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,560
Everyone was in this mess and knew that if the other delegates thought they were being

272
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,420
bullied or manipulated by the Boston radicals, that Massachusetts might find itself cut

273
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,430
loose. But luckily for them, it quickly became clear that the radicals outnumbered the

274
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,210
conservatives. And the list of delegates is just a list of Revolutionary War leaders.

275
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,990
The Adams is Patrick Henry, Richard, Henry Lee, George Washington, John Dickinson, Thomas

276
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,790
Mifflin, Silas Dean.

277
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,270
These guys were ready to act as the Continental Congress convened them up in

278
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:49,130
Massachusetts. A meeting of the various committees of correspondence would help define

279
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,290
what action the Congress ultimately decided to take, because the result of this meeting

280
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,880
was the Suffolk resolves Suffolk being the county within which Boston was located.

281
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:04,490
Written by Dr. Joseph Warren, who had taken control of the radicals with the Adams is in

282
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,590
Philadelphia. The Suffolk resolves unequivocally move the colony toward war.

283
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,590
Beyond the obvious economic boycotts, citizens were encouraged to simply ignore the

284
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,930
coercive acts, stop paying their taxes and most importantly, to take control of the local

285
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:26,360
militias and quote, do use their utmost diligence to acquaint themselves with the art of

286
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,740
war. As soon as possible.

287
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,270
And do for that purpose appear underarms at least once every week.

288
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,860
The results were passed on September the 9th and a draft was sent down to Philadelphia by

289
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,980
a guy who next week is going to make an even more famous ride.

290
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,610
Boston silversmith Paul Revere The Suffolk Resolves.

291
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,320
We're not just accepted by the Congress.

292
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,600
They were endorsed and destroyed whatever hope the conservatives had of controlling the

293
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,020
debate with the results in hand.

294
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,400
The delegates turned to what the colonies collectively ought to do about the intolerable

295
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,420
acts. Richard Henry Lee move that a national militia be formed.

296
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,880
But this was going too far, too fast.

297
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,440
And they settled on merely alerting the various colonies to take steps to make sure that

298
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,850
their local militias were trained.

299
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,100
Less controversial was agreeing not to import or consume British goods.

300
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,650
But now, on sure footing, the Massachusetts delegation decided to push for a further

301
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,530
step, one that would hurt the colonies but would hopefully hurt Britain even more non

302
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,520
exportation. Now, this was no small thing.

303
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,210
And even in this assembly of Patriots, it stirred heated debate.

304
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,490
The Massachusetts delegation was talking about severing all trade with Britain, which

305
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,280
everyone knew would be an economic disaster.

306
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,380
The Virginia delegation, for example, would only agree to non exportation if it did not

307
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,770
take effect until August 1775.

308
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,820
The wheels of the tobacco economy were already in motion and trying to stop it before the

309
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,590
next shipment in August 1775 would simply be asking too much.

310
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,890
After that, they could make plans to deal with the repercussions.

311
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,400
But before that, now we would all be destroyed.

312
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,500
Then the South Carolina delegation spoke up and said, well, we'll get on board with this,

313
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,050
but we'll need an exemption for Rice and Indigo.

314
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,340
Now, they took a beating for this and we're accused of trying to sell their vote.

315
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,980
But the men of South Carolina did have a point.

316
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,270
The other colonies could find foreign ports to dump their stuff.

317
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,890
But South Carolina rice and indigo ship exclusively to British ports.

318
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,900
Shutting down exports to Britain meant basically shutting down South Carolina completely,

319
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,480
something none of the other colonies faced.

320
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,090
After a great deal of wrangling, the two sides wound up splitting the difference.

321
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,620
Rice would be exempted.

322
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,770
Indigo would not then.

323
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,310
Surprisingly, the delegates managed to avoid any further special deals.

324
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,280
And by early October, the plan was struck.

325
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,830
Non consumption would begin immediately.

326
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,540
Non importation would begin December the 1st to allow for orders already on the way.

327
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,800
Non exportation would begin September the 10th, 1775 if you know nothing happened.

328
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:18,680
In the meantime. To enforce these boycotts, the Congress created what is known as the

329
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:23,090
Continental Association, or more often simply the association.

330
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,140
Local committees would be formed to police their neighbors and make sure that no one

331
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,880
cheated. And though they did not know it at the time, by creating the association,

332
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,260
Congress had actually just created the skeleton of the Revolutionary War effort.

333
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,400
Because when the fighting breaks out come the spring of 1775.

334
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,050
The committees that formed the association seamlessly transition from their original

335
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:51,240
purpose of enforcing a boycott to running all necessary wartime logistics at the local

336
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,350
level. Fundraising, troop raising, requisitioning supplies.

337
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,610
Intelligence gathering.

338
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:02,970
These committees soon became the backbone of the revolution after formally signing the

339
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,830
association. On October the 20th, the first Continental Congress disbanded on October

340
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,570
twenty sixth and sent their delegates home to gear up for the boycott, agreeing to

341
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,520
reconvene for a second Continental Congress on May the 10th, 1775.

342
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:24,430
As soon as the delegates arrived home, the various colonies got to work, setting up local

343
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,770
branches of the association and come December, the first enforcing the non importation

344
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,290
part of plan in this.

345
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,350
The association was an unqualified success.

346
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,000
The governor of Virginia, for example, complained that the citizens paid more heed to the

347
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,390
directives of the association and they did to the colonial government.

348
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,520
The response to all this back in Britain was harsh.

349
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,780
Lord North declared that if the colonies wouldn't trade with Britain, then they sure as

350
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,580
hell weren't going to trade with anyone else.

351
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,250
And he laid out a plan for a continental blockade.

352
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,280
Meanwhile, General Gage repeated warnings that the Intolerable Act were doing exactly the

353
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,260
opposite of what they were supposed to be doing.

354
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,490
They were supposed to be isolating Massachusetts and scaring everyone else into

355
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:15,130
submission. Instead, they were cementing colonial solidarity and intensifying resistance.

356
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,860
He asked for the ministry to withdraw the intolerable acts, and if not, then please send

357
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,030
twenty thousand troops because maybe then I'll be able to get a handle on things.

358
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,660
All this did was convince the ministry that General Gage probably wasn't the man for the

359
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,660
job. And they dispatched three generals to act as military advisors.

360
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,870
William, how Henry Clinton and John Bourgoyne.

361
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,680
Next week, everything will break down once and for all.

362
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,200
General gages attempt to lock up all the guns and powder in Massachusetts will lead to

363
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,180
armed confrontations with local militias in Lexington and Concord, where someone

364
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,020
somewhere fired the shot heard round the world.
