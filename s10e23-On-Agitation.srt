00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,810
This week's episode is brought to you by Herries.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,390
Who are you shopping for this holiday season?

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,400
And do you know what you are getting them?

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,590
That time is already upon us.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,950
And I have a brilliant suggestion that is both thoughtful and practical.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,030
A Harrys holiday set, which is a gift they will actually use.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,070
And right now, Harrys is offering their starter shave kit and a handsome holiday gift box

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,680
starting at just $20.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,230
So it will always fall under nearly every Secret Santa limit.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,950
Now, this is either the fifth or sixth holiday season.

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,820
I've been through with Harrys and I have always found the holiday boxes to be a great

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,550
idea. Simple, elegant, affordable.

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,200
So whether you are buying for somebody else or making your own list, I can tell you that

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,890
the holiday gift sets really are a great gift and one that will keep on giving in

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,390
perpetuity because you'll be able to get a great shave at a reasonable price for the rest

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,030
of the year. As a special offer for fans of the show, we have partnered with Harrys to

Hello and welcome to revolutions.

26
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,560
Episode twenty two point twenty three on agitation.

27
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,510
Last time we did the biographical introduction of Lenin and croup scale.

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,620
And though I called them Vladimir and Nadia last week for future clarity, I will be

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,180
referring to them by their better known names, Lenin and Crips guy.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,410
Lucky for us, we ended last week with their first meeting in February 1894, where this

31
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,810
man, Vladimir Ilyich, read aloud from a book that would be the first book he published

32
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,010
under the pen name Lenin.

33
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,390
And though he would use a bunch of different nom de plumes in his life in revolutionary

34
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,760
letters, Lenin would be the one that stuck.

35
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,670
And the one that would become his permanent public identity.

36
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,920
So where we left them was in St.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,960
Petersburg in 1894, working in the Revolutionary Underground just about six months before

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,620
the ascension of Czar Nicholas, the second who they would in twenty five years ensure

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,670
would be the last czar of Russia.

40
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,950
The Revolutionary Underground at the time of Nicholas's ascension was a tug of war,

41
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,260
pitting the reemergence neon to wrote usts, who will wind up forming the Assads against

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,150
the Marxists like Lenin and Crips guy'll who will go on to form the Social Democratic

43
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,380
Labour Party of Russia.

44
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,680
These two groups had plenty to disagree about, but also had a lot in common.

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,750
And one of the biggest things they had in common was that they were really only talking

46
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,530
to each other. This was coffee house radicalism.

47
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,570
This was salon bickering.

48
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,230
The Assads were arguing in favor of the rural peasants.

49
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,170
The Marxist were arguing in favor of the industrial workers.

50
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,430
But there were no actual peasants or workers involved in this argument.

51
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,070
These discussion circles of young radical members of the intelligentsia were insular.

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,240
These people were coming out of the middle and upper classes and they wore suits.

53
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,660
They sported university educations and they had uncap fist hands in the parlance of our

54
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,690
times. They are 100 percent white collar.

55
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,820
Now, when the earlier peoples will type's had faced the problem of how to connect with

56
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,220
the capital P people.

57
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,710
They went to the people and then they got sent back by the people.

58
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,760
And so they concluded that it was hopeless and they simply had to do the revolution for

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,500
themselves. But this is not how Lenin and his comrades are going to want to do things.

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,170
They don't want to do the revolution for themselves.

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,970
They wanted know they needed to get the proletariat involved.

62
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,900
So that left them facing a vexing question how to connect to the working class who are

63
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,810
meant to be the leaders of our socialist revolution.

64
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,160
This was a real problem for Lenin and one that could not just be dismissed because to

65
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,330
reiterate the point I made when we were talking about plan' off and the emancipation of

66
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,790
labor group. Lenin read Marx historical materialism, the nature of class conflict and the

67
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,250
role of the proletariat and the socialist revolution.

68
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,480
And he believed it.

69
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,310
If they were going to follow the scientific program of some future history they believe

70
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,900
Marx and Engels had laid down.

71
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,720
It was going to take the proletariat as a class doing the necessary revolutionary work,

72
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,940
not just a handful of effete coffee house radicals.

73
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,510
And that brings me to another point I need to make about Lenin.

74
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,640
That when he committed himself to Marxism, he also committed himself to the doctrine of

75
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,580
two revolutions as elaborated by plan' off that because Russia was still laboring under a

76
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,740
medieval mode of agrarian production.

77
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,270
They were going to have to undergo a bourgeois capitalist revolution in order to

78
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,730
sufficiently transform the country for a subsequent socialist revolution for Lenin.

79
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,890
Capitalism was not something he liked, but it was something he considered a vital and

80
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,300
inevitable force of history.

81
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,400
Without it, Russia would remain condemned to the stagnant despotism of orthodoxy,

82
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,680
autocracy and nationality for ever without the historical power of capitalism,

83
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,490
modernizing the Russian economy, increasing its productive capacity, and, more

84
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,110
importantly, turning rural peasants into urban laborers.

85
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,150
The socialist revolution was simply not possible.

86
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,550
And then, of course, along with that advance of the capitalist mode of production would

87
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,980
come the first revolution, the democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie against the

88
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,630
old medieval state that oppressed them under the weight of anachronistic aristocratic

89
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,210
privilege. And that first revolution would be necessary to create the second and far

90
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,490
preferable socialist revolution.

91
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,060
Now, as they waited for this.

92
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,430
That did not mean they were just going to sit around and do nothing.

93
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,170
No, it did not. Lenin believed that they should begin now to make connections inside the

94
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:28,030
actual working class to forge at least a small skeletal structure of a political party

95
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,990
that would first add weight to the coming democratic revolution.

96
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:38,230
And second, make them ready to boldly stride towards the next socialist revolution once

97
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,770
democratic reform made open political organizing legal.

98
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:48,040
Because remember, the goal here is Marx's dictatorship of the proletariat, which was not

99
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,390
understood to mean a small Jacobin style revolutionary committee of public safety.

100
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,880
It was simply meant to express a mass majority now ruling a fully democratic system.

101
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,050
So one way to think about this is that the dictatorship of an aristocracy is a monarchy.

102
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,530
The dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is an oligarchy.

103
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,480
The coming dictatorship of the proletariat would be mass majority democracy.

104
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,250
The first system Marx always noted approvingly where the majority would actually rule.

105
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,060
That's how it's supposed to go anyway.

106
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,020
So the Russian Marxists of the 1890s believe that what they needed to do was build the

107
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,370
skeleton of an organization that would connect the socialist intelligencia to worker

108
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,530
groups inside the factories and in the rather annoying business speak language of our

109
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,170
time to have this organization be scalable.

110
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,530
But as the proletariat inevitably expanded as a result of the advance of capitalism that

111
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,510
this Proteau party they were building now would be able to grow with it and soon become

112
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,010
the party of the mass majority.

113
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,080
Now, one of the great influences on Lennon's thinking at this time was a German Marxist

114
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,400
named Karl Koutsoukis, who I briefly named checked back when we were talking about the

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,210
Emancipation of Labour Group because he was friends with Pavel Axlerod.

116
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,160
They were like neighbours in Zurich.

117
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,140
Now, I can't go overboard on Koutsoukis because this is technically a series on the

118
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,520
Russian revolution, not a general history of 19th century European socialism, though you

119
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,520
wouldn't necessarily know that from listening to our past episodes.

120
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,380
But just so you know, counts, he was one of the two or three most important Marxists in

121
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,800
the generation that came up after Marx and Angles themselves.

122
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,120
Koski was a friend, comrade, disciple, correspondant and occasionally wayward protege,

123
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,660
especially of angles.

124
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,330
What Koutsoukis advocated was a merger of the labor movement and the socialist

125
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,000
intelligentsia who were not at that point.

126
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:50,030
The same thing. Koski was arguing that the educated intelligentsia needed the manpower,

127
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,860
energy and numbers provided by the workers, and the less educated workers needed the

128
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,330
theories, ideas and direction that would be provided by the more educated members of the

129
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:05,210
intelligentsia. But again, these two groups are not necessarily primed to be bosom

130
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,670
buddies. On the one side, you have blue collar factory workers and on the other you have

131
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,980
the white collar student socialists.

132
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,840
Culturally, personally, there's a lot of mutual side iron going on.

133
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,560
But. He said these two groups must bridge their differences, recognize the advantages of

134
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,400
an alliance. The principal advantage of which was if they did combine, they could

135
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,600
literally take over the state and become Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat.

136
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,480
The merger of the socialists and the workers was the essential feature of the Social

137
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,860
Democratic Party of Germany.

138
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,170
Which is why Lenin and his friends will soon be organizing their own Russian Social

139
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,670
Democratic Labour Party.

140
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,450
And when the early 1890s, the strategy for forging connections between the workers and

141
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,970
the socialists was a process called propagandizing, which is the opposite of what we

142
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,410
usually understand the term propaganda to mean.

143
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,320
These days we are not talking about brief, manipulative messages aimed at a large

144
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,170
population, but rather an intensive course of education aimed at a select few highly

145
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,270
motivated members of the working class.

146
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:20,630
These potential propagandized workers could be identified in the kind of worker education

147
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,720
programs that Crips Gaia was dedicating her early life to.

148
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,240
If a particular student was eager and motivated, you could just keep feeding them more

149
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,610
and more books and articles and pamphlets about politics and economics and history until

150
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,280
they emerged as a fully enlightened Marxist.

151
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,360
The problem with this approach is that it was time consuming and extremely hit and miss.

152
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,070
It required patience and sustained interest from both teachers and students.

153
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,100
But if they stuck to it and kept to a strict program of propagandizing individual workers

154
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,000
in ten thousand years, they might all be ready for a revolution.

155
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,990
But what happens if you would prefer your revolution to come less than ten thousand years

156
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,730
from now? Well, we will spend the rest of today's episode talking about the new strategy

157
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,920
they would adopt. And the man who would come to St.

158
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,310
Petersburg in 1895 bearing the new gospel.

159
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,470
This guy will be very important to our story going forward as he starts out as Lenin's

160
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,140
great friend, practically Lenin's only friend, and then down the road, his bitterly

161
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,940
disappointed rival if he was never able to quite bring himself to call Lenin an enemy.

162
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,520
And this is Julius Markoff tof.

163
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,710
When it was all over, there's a near death in 1921 and reflected on the revolution, he

164
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,350
had in fact successfully hijacked and led Lenin said that he had one regret that Markoff

165
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,050
is not with us. What an amazing Conradt he is.

166
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,490
What a pure man. So let us talk about Julius Markoff.

167
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,650
Julius marched off, as we know him in the West by his Anglican ized revolutionary name

168
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:08,580
was born. On November the 24th, 1873, he was the son of a Russian Jewish family then

169
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,310
residing in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople.

170
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:17,010
Though they moved to Odessa when Mahtob was 4 years old, he had five siblings, one of

171
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,990
whom Lydia would become a revolutionary socialist Conradt in her own right, and she is

172
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,060
known to the history books as Lydia Dawn.

173
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,700
After taking her Conradt husband's name.

174
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:33,540
Their father, mother, aunts and uncles seem to have been a generation of disillusioned

175
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,270
liberals, once excited by the prospect of the great reforms they were by the 1870s,

176
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,950
disappointed how far short of the mark this our liberator had ultimately fallen.

177
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,200
Though they were Jewish, they were not particularly observant about him and Mahtob lived

178
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,760
experience as a Jew in the Russian empire, had less to do with a strong cultural or

179
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,810
religious identity built from within.

180
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,750
And more to do with the negative experiences of anti-Semitism he had to deal with from

181
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,510
without. Lydia later said that the myriad ways anti-Semitism expressed itself in Russian

182
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,310
society, both big and small, made her brothers sympathetic to any group who found itself

183
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,430
maltreated for ethnic, religious or class reasons.

184
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,760
But it did not push him towards Jewish nationalism or separatism or Zionism, all of which

185
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,330
were options on the table for radical Jews at the end of the 19th century.

186
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,500
When Mahtob was about 15 years old, the family was living in Saint Petersburg and he fell

187
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,090
in with a group of rebelliously progressive friends who clashed constantly with the more

188
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,670
Russian nationalist conservative kids at the school.

189
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:45,050
And unlike Lenin, who was always a loner, Mahtob found it easy to make and keep friends.

190
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,850
And he later remarked, I have the nasty privilege of being liked by people.

191
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,810
It was at this point that he got super into the French Revolution.

192
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,600
He read everything he could get his hands on by and about Robespierre, Danton, Daimyo La

193
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,660
Mirarr, a bear and Beb off, and he mentally advanced his own beliefs along with the

194
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,890
course of the revolution.

195
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:14,970
He said Within half a year I had gone through all the phases of revolutionary enthusiasm.

196
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,480
My model at first was Mirabeau and then the gironde discourse, and then Dunton and

197
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,590
finally Robespierre.

198
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,880
Markoff's ideological evolution would then keep following the course of European social

199
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,560
history. He read all the post Revolutionary Socialists like FOTA and Sensi moan and put

200
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,350
on. And then a friend came back from a family holiday to Switzerland loaded with banned

201
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,060
Russian revolutionary writers.

202
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,010
Lavrov and Chernus Chayefsky are among the names that we would recognize, and this

203
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,320
brought him into contact with the Russian revolutionary tradition and gave him a pretty

204
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,880
narrowest point of view.

205
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,940
Though it must be said that he also came across a journalist's account of the 1881 trial

206
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,160
of the assassins of the Czar Liberator, and walked away from that, convinced that mere

207
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,580
revolutionary terrorism was not only an insufficient strategy.

208
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,460
He was downright counterproductive.

209
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,870
Meanwhile, he got his hands on a copy of the Communist Manifesto and was stirred by its

210
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,570
call to the masses to rise up openly.

211
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,910
Let them tremble at our size and strength marched off quite like the sound of that.

212
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,630
In 1891, Markoff graduated and went off to the University of St.

213
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,150
Petersburg. He was originally studying science, but like so many of his contemporaries,

214
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,090
attending class was secondary to his real passion, which was reading dangerous literature

215
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,800
and dreaming dangerous dreams.

216
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,480
He and his friends formed a little radical reading circle and discussed everything they

217
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,850
could get their hands on. And they were idealistic enough that they wanted to reach out

218
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,030
and bring in members of the working class into this circle.

219
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,560
And they did manage to recruit one worker, and they were very proud of themselves.

220
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,810
Unfortunately, this guy allowed himself to be recruited because that was the mission he

221
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,730
had been assigned by his handlers.

222
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,620
He was a police spy.

223
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,920
And after a few meetings, he turned names over to the police.

224
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,160
One of Markoff's best friends was arrested and after a month of interrogation, he coughed

225
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,160
up Markoff's name. So Mahtob was arrested in February 1892 and then held until May.

226
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,560
But as he sat in custody, it turned out he was such a minor priority that he never really

227
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,260
got interrogated too deeply or too harshly.

228
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,260
He was just another student reading banned books.

229
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,870
In May 1892, his grandfather managed to bail him out of detention while he awaited

230
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,090
sentencing. There would be no trial.

231
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,520
Mind you, there would just be a sentence that would get handed down.

232
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,160
And while others may have emerged from this chastized by the experience, Mahtob was

233
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,110
thrilled by it all. His arrest and detention meant that he had received his revolutionary

234
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,590
baptism. He was a real revolutionary now with real credibility.

235
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,870
He was, of course, expelled from university, though his parents did manage to arrange an

236
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,300
interview with school officials to review the case.

237
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,540
If the boy was sufficiently penitent but Markoff was insufficiently penitent, he in fact

238
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,830
refused to attend the meeting.

239
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,400
The expulsion stood and he awaited his final sentence.

240
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:23,710
It was during this summer of waiting in 1892 that we come to the conversion to Marxism

241
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,510
portion of Markoff's biography.

242
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,030
He got his hands on the writings of on/off and Axelrod and a French translation of

243
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,120
capital, and he was blown away by what he read.

244
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,470
He later said that before this, his revolutionary instincts had been flimsy and

245
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,560
superficial. And now they had weight and heft.

246
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,690
He believed what he was reading was the final stop on the development of his

247
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,280
revolutionary ideology, which had begun with Mirabeau and now ended with Marx.

248
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,630
Whatever lingering Neruda's ideas he held were banished.

249
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,580
The rural peasants would be an apathetic sack of potatoes until they were turned into a

250
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,690
working class proletariat by the inevitable force of capitalist modernization.

251
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,010
Having had this conversion, Markoff received his sentence in December 1892.

252
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,590
Five months. Solitary confinement.

253
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,890
So he was arrested again and tossed in prison again.

254
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,020
And though it was technically solitary confinement, security and oversight in these

255
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,940
prisons was shockingly lax.

256
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,410
And he was able to get books to read and exchange letters and writing with friends that

257
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,510
were never much analyzed or monitored.

258
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,640
We'll talk more about this later.

259
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:39,420
But though the TSA's police state was aiming for omnipresent totalitarian suppression, it

260
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,640
would always be hampered by limited personnel, limited resources, limited talent and

261
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,160
limited interest at all levels.

262
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,050
If you were a prison guard, you could either pore over every single sentence of every

263
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,770
single letter that came and went or you could not.

264
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,490
Mahtob was hoping his five months in prison would be it.

265
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,250
But when he got out in May of 1893, he received a further sentence two years of

266
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,480
administrative exile.

267
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,960
Now, he would be allowed to choose his destination.

268
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,700
It just couldn't be a city with a university in order to keep him away from other

269
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,070
students. But someone tipped him off that interesting things were happening in what was

270
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,520
then called Vilna and what is today Vilnius, Lithuania.

271
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,970
So he said, I'll go to Vienna.

272
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,270
And in June 1893, he got on a train and left St.

273
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,470
Petersburg for exile.

274
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,920
And it was in this, quote unquote exile that Julius Markoff really found his own

275
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,180
revolutionary potential.

276
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,850
So Vilna was a part of Lithuania, which had once been a part of Poland, Lithuania, and

277
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,060
had come under Russian had Germany during the great partitions of Poland.

278
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,820
So one of the principal reasons that interesting things were happening in Vilna was

279
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,800
because the authorities there were mostly focused on Polish nationalists, not Russian

280
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,940
socialists. The other reason is that these interesting things that were happening were

281
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,750
happening in the Jewish community, which was really off the radar of the local

282
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,370
authorities, Jewish factory workers often worked for Jewish factory owners.

283
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,260
And so the local Russian authorities considered labor relations in those industries to be

284
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,000
an internal Jewish affair.

285
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,210
So Jewish socialists in Vilna operated uniquely unmonitored and en harassed.

286
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,650
And so even though he was in administrative exile and had to check in with those local

287
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,420
Russian authorities, then not yet 20 year old Mahtob was able to jumpstart his

288
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,440
revolutionary career.

289
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,820
Mahtob make contact with the local Jewish socialists immediately.

290
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,460
The most important of these being Arkady Kramer and Kramer gets to go down as the father

291
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,880
of the Jewish Labor Bund.

292
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,210
And if you know what that means, then great.

293
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,380
If you don't, we'll talk all about the Bund when we get to the formation of the Russian

294
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,850
Social Democratic Labour Party.

295
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,340
Now, initially, Markoff was deployed as a teacher of economics and politics and history,

296
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,020
doing propagandizing among the workers to turn them in to fully enlightened Marxists.

297
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,440
But they did find plenty of eager students.

298
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,800
It was always going to be slow going and slow building.

299
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:24,150
So over the winter of 1893 1894, krammer Ma Tof and a few others strategized and the

300
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,860
conclusion they came to was that they needed a new strategy, but they needed to move from

301
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:35,370
propagandizing to agitation, and this strategy would thereafter be referred to as the

302
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:41,990
Vilna program. Now, they started doing it before they wrote about it, but the Vilna

303
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,900
program was summed up by a pamphlet published in 1895 called On Agitation that was

304
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,670
devised by Kramer and the other Vilna veterans and written up by Martos, who they

305
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:58,250
discovered, much to their delight, was a very good writer on agitation, was not pure

306
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,210
invention. They were not inventing this out of whole cloth and had many sources feeding

307
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:08,000
into it. Karl Koutsoukis in the German program, of course, but also a piece that on/off

308
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,380
had written in 1891 in response to the famine, saying that socialists should take

309
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,270
advantage of the crisis to set down literary debate and go out among the people to give a

310
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,110
name and a purpose and a direction to their immediate angry suffering.

311
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,260
But on agitation became the touchstone for the new organizing strategy that Russian

312
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,500
Marxists would embrace by agitation.

313
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,280
They meant ditching abstract philosophy for concrete issues.

314
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:40,220
For starters, do less talking and more listening to the workers.

315
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,340
Find out what they specifically hated about their job.

316
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,680
The long hours, low wages, docked pay, living conditions, safety concerns, whatever.

317
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,420
Piss them off. Find out about it.

318
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,670
Listen to them. Then bring it back.

319
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,200
Review it. Collate it.

320
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,780
Condense it. Draw it up in a crisp declaration that enumerated those complaints and then

321
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,260
publish it on a single leaflet and get it spread around the factory.

322
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,340
Is this what you want? Because if it is, there is a way to get it.

323
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,680
And that way is to go on strike.

324
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,680
This is the heart of agitation.

325
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,290
Taking nebulous resentment and turning it into direct action helped the workers realize

326
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,400
the benefits of group action to achieve what are clearly their shared goals.

327
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,650
The role of the socialist intelligentsia was to give voice and direction through leaflets

328
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,650
and maybe pamphlets, but not much more than that.

329
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,030
And in many ways, the debates over the merits of this strategy is whether the revolution

330
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,310
is going to be won with 500 page books about abstract philosophy or single page leaflets

331
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,540
about better pay.

332
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,020
The group in Vilna was saying leaflets.

333
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,510
Now, I know what you're saying, and you're right.

334
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,510
This strategy is anathema to traditional Russian anarchist and narrowest ideology, which

335
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,730
said we must not engage with such petty concerns that even if you won a shorter work day

336
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,590
or a few more rubles a month, in exchange, you are granting the premise and legitimacy of

337
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,210
an exploitive capitalist system.

338
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:13,500
More comfortable chains are still chains, plus small material improvements will sap the

339
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,830
revolutionary energy of the workers, make them complacent.

340
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,000
But on agitation argued the opposite.

341
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,880
It's at the very act of going on strike together and demanding better conditions.

342
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,840
Not asking, demanding would enhance the revolutionary class consciousness of the workers,

343
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,850
not diminish it. That coming together to agitate for concrete shared demands.

344
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,500
The experience of going on strike, suffering hardship together, and hopefully winning

345
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,100
concessions together would create solidarity and trust.

346
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,620
Getting an hour knocked off the workday or getting a slight increase in wages would not

347
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,700
be the end of anything.

348
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,240
It would be the beginning. So for starters, yes.

349
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,110
Agitate for small issues related to individual factories or sectors.

350
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,080
Once this organization is up and running to accomplish small goals, it can be turned to

351
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,190
bigger and more political projects and the workers will turn to those projects with

352
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,140
experience and confidence.

353
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,240
If the revolutionary proletariat is necessary for the achievement of a socialist

354
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,560
revolution, then this is one way to start building the revolutionary proletariat.

355
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,570
And it is certainly quicker and easier than waiting for every single life operator to

356
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:28,710
graduate from propaganda school with the equivalent of a master's degree in Marxist

357
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,270
economics. Now, there was one further aspect to the Vilna program that was specific to

358
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,650
Vilna, but which did have broader applicability as a general theory.

359
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,450
The problem they were having among the Jewish workers is that most of them spoke Yiddish

360
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,270
while the socialist intelligentsia spoke Russian.

361
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:50,950
So the Vilna socialist came to a conclusion that's kind of obvious.

362
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,650
Let's write our leaflets in Yiddish.

363
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,510
Don't make them come to us.

364
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,630
Let us go to them now in Vilna.

365
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,270
There was literally a language barrier to overcome.

366
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,340
But in broader strategic terms, speaking the language of the worker, whether it be

367
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,950
literally another language or merely dialect or expressions, are relateable references or

368
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,270
simple sentences.

369
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,450
The important thing was to speak their language.

370
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,950
And one of the most persistent complaints that would be lobbed back at the exiled leaders

371
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,390
like Tarnoff is that they produce nothing the average worker could read or understand.

372
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,850
That was going to have to change if we actually want to organize the masses, not just

373
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,350
talk amongst ourselves.

374
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,090
Now, of course, what krammer and Ma Tof and the others in Vilna were doing wasn't just

375
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,510
speaking the language of the worker, they were Jews working among Jews.

376
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,560
And what we're watching right now is something close to the foundation of the Jewish

377
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,300
Labor Bund, the organization of Jewish Socialists who believed in maintaining a separate

378
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,760
organization of Jewish socialists because Jews faced unique Jewish problems that required

379
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,380
unique Jewish solutions.

380
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,690
And this is going to be an issue down the road once the real revolutions get going.

381
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,120
And I do promise eventually there will be real revolutions that get going.

382
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,950
I mean, was there a place for a Jewish identity inside a movement so committed to

383
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,500
defining the world in terms of economic class?

384
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,750
These are questions we will get to later.

385
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,890
So this agitation strategy was outlined and implemented in by May of 1895, Mahtob was

386
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,300
able to give a speech to a group of about 400 Conrads announcing that it had been a

387
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,440
resounding success.

388
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,630
Their organization was bigger than ever.

389
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,250
They were more democratic than ever.

390
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,960
They were more worker focused than ever.

391
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,930
They actually had workers in their organization.

392
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,230
But this success and their desire to spread the idea to other cities face pushback.

393
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,400
There were intelligencia socialists who enjoyed their pamphlets and books and

394
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,630
intellectual debates.

395
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,680
They wanted to talk theoretical forces of history, not a 10 hour workday.

396
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,970
Then there were the propagandize workers who had achieved enlightenment.

397
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,050
For them, their emergence from a previous state of ignorance was the whole point of the

398
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,300
revolution. It's certainly what they personally valued above all and they saw in the

399
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:10,480
Vilna program and they read in on agitation and abandonment of that effort, a strategy

400
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,140
that would leave their fellow workers in their ignorance in exchange for a few more

401
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,550
rubles in their pockets.

402
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,080
And they were offended by the idea that it was not worth the time or effort to educate

403
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,130
those workers fully.

404
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,110
Then all they were good for was bodies in the street and that down the road they would be

405
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,060
turned into revolutionary cannon fodder.

406
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,240
Dying on behalf of their intelligencia leaders.

407
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,290
The other big objection, an objection that Lenin and Markoff would themselves soon be

408
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:42,090
making is what happens if the Vilna program becomes an end unto itself.

409
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,550
Agitation for strikes on behalf of factory workers to address their particular grievances

410
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:52,320
was great as long as it was a step on the way to the political revolution.

411
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,580
But as the years went on, others in the movement would say this focus on improving the

412
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,370
economic status of the workers is practically all that matters.

413
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,770
The people who would take up this argument would later be disparagingly referred to as

414
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:11,710
the economists and be added to Lenin's very long list of revolutionary Philistines that

415
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,750
he carried around with him in his pocket.

416
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,030
But as we will see next week right here at this moment in 1895, Lenin is going to be

417
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,620
totally on board with this program.

418
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,470
He will read on agitation and embrace it.

419
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,750
He will meet Mahtob and embrace him.

420
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,390
And next week, we will see how well they are rewarded for this change in strategy, which

421
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,440
will be, you guessed it, exile in Siberia.
