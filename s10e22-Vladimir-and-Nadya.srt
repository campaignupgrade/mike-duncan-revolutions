28
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,090
Episode. Ten point twenty two.

29
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,950
Vladimír and Najia.

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,960
So here we are at episode 22 into our series on the Russian Revolution, and I am just now

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,090
getting to the people who will be the main characters going forward and to the guy who

32
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,560
would probably be the main character if this wherever, say, adapted as a prestige

33
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,750
television show. Just throwing that out there.

34
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,300
But if you have friends who like to wait until I am done with the series before bingeing

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,650
at all at once. Be sure to tell them that we are at.

36
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,620
Episode 22 of the Russian Revolution.

37
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,500
And we have just gotten to the early life of Lenin.

38
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,280
So this new group of characters came from a generation who were too young to have been a

39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,890
part of the radical upheavals of the 1870s.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
They were just kids when Tsar Alexander the Second was assassinated.

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,260
They were in grammar school through the reactionary 1880s.

42
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,240
But by the time Tsar Nicholas the second ascended the throne in 1894, it was their turn

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,650
to be the young 20 something student radicals offended by the society within which they

44
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,140
had been raised and who were determined in the face of all of Russian history to be the

45
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,170
cohort that finally, finally pulled off a revolution.

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,970
And today we are going to introduce two of these up and coming revolutionaries who will,

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,940
in fact, in the future actually pull off the revolution.

48
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,320
Vladimir Elliot Liyana, known to history as Lenin, and his wife, now Déja Konstantin Nova

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:27,650
crimps Gaia. Vladimir Ilyich We on/off was born on April the 10th, 1870 in Cim Biersack,

50
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,020
a small provincial city on the Volga River.

51
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,560
The Ulyanovsk were an upwardly mobile family, not rich by any means, but fine specimens

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,650
of a respectable and prosperous provincial middle class.

53
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,630
Vladimir's paternal grandfather had been a serf who managed to transcend his status

54
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,330
sometime around eighteen hundred.

55
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,770
His son, Alia Ulanoff, Vladimir's father, had then received a good education and

56
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:58,760
graduated in 1854, joining the civil service as an inspector of schools, an energetic and

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,010
reform minded bureaucrat, Elliott Whouley.

58
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,910
Enough entered state service just as Tsar Alexander the Second was ascending the throne

59
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,520
and preparing his period of capital G.

60
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,740
Capital R. Great reform himself, only a generation removed from serfdom.

61
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,730
Will on/off was thrilled by almost everything those our liberator did.

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,410
The emancipation of the serfs was a work of profound, enlightened justice, and the

63
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:26,990
directives to create the zemser and improve local primary education gave his life purpose

64
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,960
settling in some biersack while John F.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,700
traveled the region, setting up and monitoring new primary and grammar schools all

66
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,230
through the 1860s and 1870s, he was happy, fulfilled and respected.

67
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,580
Vladimir's mother, Maria Alexandrovna, came from a good family herself.

68
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,680
Her father was a doctor and her mother, a German, descended Protestant from the Balkans.

69
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,530
Now, given that Vladimir's paternal grandmother was probably of comic descent, the comic

70
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,320
where people who trace back to the Mongolians on the Volga.

71
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,010
Vladimir's ethnic ancestry told the demographic story of the Russian empire after his

72
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,690
death. This demographic story was given additional drama when one of Lenin sisters

73
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,520
discovered that their maternal great grandfather had actually been a Jew who converted to

74
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,110
orthodoxy and then raised his kids Christian.

75
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,470
When Stalin was presented with this revelation, he ordered the information suppressed.

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,510
Now, Lenin himself had no real anti-Semitic tendencies to speak of, and his sister

77
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,700
actually wanted to publicize this genealogical revelation to cut down on anti-Semitism in

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,490
Soviet Russia. But Stalin was an anti-Semite, so the information was suppressed.

79
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,250
But getting back to his mother, Maria Alexandrovna gave birth to eight babies, six of

80
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,460
whom lived of whom Vladimir was third oldest.

81
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,420
She held small C conservative vish bourgeois values, but insisted that her three boys and

82
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,770
three girls receive equal and equally rigorous educations.

83
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,110
She instilled in them a passion for learning and a competitive spirit to succeed.

84
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,400
And even though she never really understood her children's politics, she was not

85
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,450
surprised that they followed their mind in their hearts into radical revolutionary

86
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:17,430
action. And whatever happened in the future, she would always support her kids with money

87
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,130
and aid and the necessary begging of forgiveness from the authorities, which there would

88
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:29,490
be quite a lot of. So the elder Ulyanovsk had a conservative liberal disposition.

89
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,530
Their children really did not.

90
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,200
Young Vladimir was raised by both his parents to work hard, study hard and excel at

91
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,000
everything. And from an early age, he was blunt, sarcastic and arrogant.

92
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,530
But he could always back this up with high marks and superior ability.

93
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,240
A fellow student later said that Vladimir was esteemed, but he wasn't exactly liked.

94
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,970
And he had few real friends.

95
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,130
He was on the verge of his 11th birthday when the Tsar Liberator was assassinated on

96
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,020
March the 1st, 1881.

97
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,460
This was a shocking event that had his father weeping off and on for days.

98
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,920
The emotional blow of his revered tsar getting killed pave the way for professional

99
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,870
setbacks as the new reactionary regime of Tsar Alexander, the third preferred returning

100
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,760
primary education to the church.

101
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,360
So Dad's career of opening more modern secular schools stalled out and became far less

102
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,510
fulfilling. But he kept working as hard as he possibly could and probably working too

103
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,750
hard because his health began to fail him in his early 50s.

104
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,450
In January 1886, he went into his office one day, had a stroke and died.

105
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,180
Vladamir was just 15 years old.

106
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,000
I have yet to read a single biography of Lenin or even the briefest biographical sketch.

107
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,120
Come to think of it, that does not transition out of his father's death with a line like,

108
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,620
but his father's death was immediately followed by an even greater emotional blow.

109
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,560
And you know what? Why reinvent the wheel?

110
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,180
His father's death was immediately followed by an even greater emotional blow.

111
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,540
His older brother Alexander, known to all as Sasha, was the alpha of a brood of Lee

112
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,310
on/off children who were something resembling a little band of prodigies.

113
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,440
A deadly serious student, Sasha always got top marks, was head of his class, and went off

114
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,550
to university in St.

115
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,370
Petersburg, pursuing a degree in the natural sciences.

116
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,840
All his professors agreed they were witnessing the beginning of a brilliant career.

117
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,650
Now, as academic focus was on the biology of worms, but kind of out of nowhere, his real

118
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,440
passion suddenly became radical politics.

119
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,810
Now this is 1886.

120
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,920
And remember, the old people's will network has been broken and the radical

121
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,660
revolutionaries are at their nadir.

122
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,420
So Sasha's move into radicalism was self-directed and pretty self organized.

123
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,590
It was really just him and some friends.

124
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,270
And though they would adopt the name people's will for their group, they had nothing

125
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,340
whatsoever to do with the original people's well.

126
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,340
Their tactics, however, did follow the original group's line.

127
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,880
Sasha and his friends wanted a mass mobilized Socialist Party operating out in the open.

128
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,530
But that was simply not possible under the reactionary repression of the current regime.

129
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,840
Without the opportunity to voice their opinions or even put to work their elite

130
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,180
educations on behalf of the country they loved.

131
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,520
They had no choice but to attack the regime until it either collapsed or allowed for

132
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,040
political freedom. So they followed in the spiritual footsteps of the original people's

133
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,290
will. They formed a small cell of revolutionary comrades and concocted a terrorist plot

134
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,020
to kill the Tsar. Sasha sold the watch he had won as an academic prize and used the money

135
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,250
to buy components and supplies to make bombs to blow up the Tsar.

136
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,080
Now, usually in these days, a half baked plot like this would be uncovered early by the

137
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,480
Irana or just as often the would be assassins would find the job too hard or too risky.

138
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,700
But Sosha followed through.

139
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,650
He succeeded in acquiring the supplies and building the bombs, and he and his fellow

140
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,180
conspirators plan to use them.

141
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,760
On March the 1st, 1887, the sixth anniversary of the assassination of this our liberator.

142
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,570
But it did not work out, though, the assassins were ready.

143
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,720
The tsar did not appear where they thought he was going to appear.

144
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,270
Then one of them was picked up on an unrelated charge of being suspicious in public.

145
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,310
And it wasn't until he was in custody that the police realized he was carrying a bomb.

146
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,590
The guy confessed to everything.

147
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,290
And the other 14 conspirators who were in on this plot were picked up, including Sasha,

148
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,790
who then proceeded to nobly attempt to take responsibility for everything, saying it was

149
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,710
all his idea and all his work.

150
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,270
Back home in some Biersack, the family was shocked at how far and how fast Sosha had

151
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,190
gotten mixed up in such big trouble.

152
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,980
His mother did everything she could to try to get him released or merely exiled or given

153
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,210
some other reduced sentence.

154
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,370
But this isn't like he had been found with banned books or busted, leading a seditious

155
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,420
discussion circle.

156
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,790
By Sasha's own admission, he was a bomb maker who was making bombs to kill the tsar.

157
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,410
This is real life stuff.

158
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,230
So 10 of his fellow accomplices were ultimately sentenced to terms of prison or exile.

159
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,800
But Sasha and four others were sentenced to be hanged.

160
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,940
And right to the very end, his mother thought those hour would commute the sentence.

161
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,880
Now that the boys had had the fear of God and death put in them.

162
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,190
But clemency never came.

163
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,310
On May the 8th, 1887, Alexander well, John off and four of his friends were hanged.

164
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:55,120
The execution of Sasha was a shock to the Ulyanovsk and their neighbors, though he and

165
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,020
his younger brother Vladimir were very different people and were never exactly friends.

166
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,040
Vladimir had always looked up to to the point of a worshipped his older brother.

167
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,750
Everyone in the family had.

168
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,050
And though he almost never spoke about any of this in the future.

169
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,760
It left Latimer hostile and embittered towards the state that had murdered his brother.

170
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,640
In his mind, soshe is only real crime had been bravely standing up to an evil regime.

171
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,670
So who knows how much of his life and career was personal.

172
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,210
Adding to this resentful bitterness was that after the scandal broke in town, the

173
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,290
respectable and polite families in Bierce iced the Ulyanovsk out.

174
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,670
They stopped coming around, they stopped inviting the family to parties or including them

175
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,430
in anything but whispered gossip behind their backs.

176
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,070
The social treatment was so bad that his only recently widowed mother sold the family

177
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,350
house and they all moved out of town for good.

178
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,720
And it has been remarked on more than one occasion that this treatment may have played a

179
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,340
role in Vladimir's future.

180
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:02,880
Deep, deep hatred of hypocritical bourgeois liberals, treacherous, two faced bastards who

181
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,170
cannot ever be trusted.

182
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,750
That was his consistent and unshakable belief.

183
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,200
Now, perhaps this reads too much into it.

184
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,430
But then again, deep seated beliefs do have to come from somewhere.

185
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,400
Now, we cannot go on before mentioning the story that Lennon's sister Maria told after

186
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,010
Lennon's death. She said that upon hearing the news of Sasha's execution, that Vladamir

187
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,660
shook his head and said, no, we will go another way, Sasha.

188
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,380
Which then became something of a colloquial aphorism in Soviet Russia.

189
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,350
Now the story itself is for sure.

190
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,040
A later invention, Maria was only nine.

191
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,920
Vladimir was a teenager who had never yet showed any interest in politics.

192
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,860
But while the story and the quote were an invention, it did capture a basic truth.

193
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,380
Lenin would always have a healthy disdain for the kind of elite people's will terrorism

194
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:02,620
that Sasha had attempted, and in the attempt proved once again how inadequate a strategy

195
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,630
it was. And though he wouldn't necessarily turn his nose up at plots to assassinate

196
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:13,390
Czarist officials, the future Lenin would never think it was the main work of revolution.

197
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:20,160
One lesson Vladimír or any of his siblings did not take away from the execution of their

198
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,530
brother was to stay out of politics.

199
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,380
When Vladimír arrived at the University of Cars on in the fall of 1887, he immediately

200
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,630
joined student activist groups and took part in demonstrations, one of which was so big

201
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,120
that more than 150 kids were arrested.

202
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,800
But even though he was not a leader of this demonstration, Vladimír was one of the few to

203
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,940
be expelled for his involvement because holy hell, this guy's early and often he's the

204
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,890
brother of that guy we just hanged for trying to kill.

205
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,590
Those are now kicked out of school.

206
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,840
Vladimir was ordered to confine himself to a country estate owned by his extended family,

207
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,710
where he wound up spending almost the entirety of 1888.

208
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,100
And he spent this time enforced idleness, reading and reading and reading some more.

209
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,450
And it was during this period that he finally came across what is to be done by a

210
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,210
Chayefsky? Vladimir loved what is to be done.

211
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,510
He loved it so much. He read it six times over the summer, and he was enthralled by the

212
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,640
main ultra dedicated revolutionary character, the same character who had once inspired me

213
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,090
life. So Vladimir loved what is to be done.

214
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,780
He loved it so much that in the future he literally carried a small picture of Turness

215
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,760
Chayefsky with him in his wallet, a claim that could not be made by Marx or Engels or

216
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,730
even his wife. And in a very real way, it was Turness Chayefsky more than Marx who turned

217
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,860
Vladimir into Lenin.

218
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,180
But that is not to say he did not also fall in love with marks and angles.

219
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,250
He did. In fact, he does it right now.

220
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,060
His mother managed to get the de facto house arrest lifted and the family moved back to

221
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,500
cars on. And though Vladimir was not allowed to return to university, he continued to

222
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,750
educate himself, though he was assisted by local radical discussion groups that he

223
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,580
continued to slip in and out of.

224
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:15,600
So in 1889, he got his hands on his first copy of Capital and the Communist Manifesto and

225
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,880
Simple on/off, which he read and which thrilled him from this point on.

226
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,590
He's a full throated Marxist.

227
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,270
Now we will obviously have plenty of time to talk all about Lennon's understanding of

228
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,160
Marxism in theory and in practice.

229
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,230
But suffice it to say that he believed what he was reading gave him a historical

230
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,270
blueprint for a great heroic struggle that would inevitably see the people triumph over

231
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,350
evil despotism.

232
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,010
Now, understandably, his mother was not too keen on the direction he was headed, and she

233
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,630
purchased a country estate, partly in the hopes of turning her son into a productive

234
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,850
landed farmer. But Vladimir did not take to farming and farming did not take to Vladimir.

235
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,650
So instead he managed to get permission to take law exams, even though he was not a

236
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,120
graduate of any university.

237
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,520
And after a year of intensive, self-directed study, he aced the exam in the spring of

238
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,410
1891 with top marks.

239
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,330
Doing on his own in 12 months what it usually took a student about four years of law

240
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,530
school to accomplish.

241
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,650
Say what you want about Lenin.

242
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,220
He was not done.

243
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,760
But this small triumph was knocked down by another tragedy.

244
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:29,430
His sister Olga, the sibling with whom Vladimir was closest and who I've read was

245
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,470
considered the real genius of the family, which is saying something slowly succumb to

246
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,980
typhoid. Vladimir lived with her at this point and nursed her, but to no avail, and she

247
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,680
died in May of 1891, practically in his arms.

248
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,190
He was devastated. Shortly after passing the law exams and burying his sister came the

249
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,070
great famine of 1891 to 1892.

250
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,700
And here there are conflicting accounts about Vladimir's attitude.

251
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,910
All of these attitudes were reported much later.

252
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,030
And all of them were meant to either attack or defend him.

253
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,130
If you hate Lenin, the story is that he openly opposed relief efforts for the peasants.

254
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,510
But he insisted the famine was a progressive historical force that would help destroy the

255
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,620
archaic villages and drive the rural peasantry into the cities where they would grow the

256
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,900
ranks of his beloved urban proletariat.

257
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,940
This version has Lenin glorying and human suffering in order to have his way.

258
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,090
Now, if you like Lenin, you say all of that is made up and it doesn't actually fit with

259
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,710
his beliefs or his actions.

260
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,540
Because during these same years he would be arguing in debates that any social democratic

261
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,890
party worth its salt must address the daily miseries of the people they were trying to

262
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,360
convert. And it feels off that he would say we should oppose something like famine

263
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,420
relief. Now both sides can point to Lennon's later conduct, both cruel or compassionate.

264
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,310
That backs up their version of the Lenin opposed famine relief story.

265
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,040
Now, do I think it's at least plausible that he saw the failed relief and mass suffering

266
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,420
as politically advantageous?

267
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,390
Sure, because it was.

268
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,390
In 1893, Vladimír finally moved to the big city for good.

269
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,820
He arrived in St. Petersburg in August, got hooked up with a not too difficult associate

270
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,620
lawyer's position that allowed him to spend most of his time around the small but growing

271
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,910
Marxist reading circles.

272
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:30,550
And in these circles, he quickly earned a reputation for a ruthless debating style,

273
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,190
withering, surgical, sarcastic, a cerebral, blunt and supremely self-confident.

274
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,730
He did not believe the debate was for persuading your opponent.

275
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,280
It was for demolishing your opponent.

276
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,350
Then whether they liked him or hated him, the people in these radical circles started

277
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,270
noticing this guy, Vladimir Ilyich.

278
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,760
This new guy who had just shown up, and one of those who heard of his growing reputation

279
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,670
was a young woman who was already established inside these St.

280
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,050
Petersburg Marxist circles.

281
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,390
Nadia Creep's Gaia.

282
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,040
Now, Des constantly Nova Cripps Gaia was born in St.

283
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:14,400
Petersburg on February the 14th, 1869, so she was just about a year older than her future

284
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,400
husband. Her family had also been pretty respectable and upwardly mobile, at least at the

285
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,490
time of her birth. Her father Constantine was the orphan's son of landless nobles whose

286
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,500
upbringing had been underwritten by the state.

287
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,650
And so he got funneled into the Army Officer Corps.

288
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,380
In 1863, Constantine was shipped off to help suppress a revolt in Poland that saw him

289
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,210
both perform well and probably emerge with some sympathy for the Poles.

290
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:48,380
But the serving well part was more important, and he was transferred off to study law in

291
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,780
St. Petersburg, where he met his wife vet to the ceiling of that.

292
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,080
She, too, had been the orphaned daughter of respectable nobility and had gotten a good

293
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,010
education that qualified her to serve as a governess, which is what she was doing for the

294
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,900
ten years before she met Constantine.

295
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,960
And though she would always be a devoutly Orthodox wife and mother, she had little good

296
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,750
to say about the kind of noble family she had lived among.

297
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,640
Certainly she passed on to her young daughter.

298
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:21,840
A love of hard work and education and a hatred of the casual cruelty of the idle rich.

299
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,660
Graduating with his law degree, Constantine was then shipped back to Warsaw with his wife

300
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,190
and new baby little Najia, to serve in the imperial administration in Poland.

301
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,040
And during his tenure in Warsaw, he operated with something of an enlightened hand.

302
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,940
He helped open a hospital, protect Jews from persecution and lay down rules that

303
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,530
regulated labor practices.

304
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,810
His wife Elizaveta, meanwhile, similarly engaged with the local culture, and she even

305
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,060
wrote a successful children's book in Polish.

306
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,970
All of which seems to have coffee, wary eye of somebody higher up in the bureaucratic

307
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,770
chain of command. Or more likely, the eye of somebody who was complaining about the labor

308
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:08,440
regulations. Because in 1874, Constantine was brought before an imperial assessor and

309
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,020
officially reprimanded for exceeding his authority.

310
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,130
He appealed the decision, but this appeal took time.

311
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,110
And in that time, his career in the civil service was totally derailed.

312
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,080
So while ages zero to five for a little nÁdya, we're stable and happy.

313
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,690
Ages 5 to 10 were disjointed, difficult and lonely as the family followed her

314
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,020
increasingly bitter and discouraged father from job to job.

315
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,570
Unable to find a place to settle down, all the while nursing a grudge against the state

316
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:46,050
that had wronged him. Probably during these troubled years of the mid 1870s, Constantine

317
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,120
developed friendly relations with people who were at least adjacent to the radicals and

318
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,000
people as well. Though he never did wind up on anybody's watch list.

319
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,870
As the family moved around chasing jobs, Najia became a lonely bookworm, but she was

320
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,100
first brought out of her growing show in the summer of 1880 when she came into contact

321
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,830
with an energetic and idealistic young teacher.

322
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,050
The eleven year old Nadia latched onto this teacher and was allowed to hang out and sit

323
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,060
in on classes that were above her level.

324
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,490
And it was this teacher who first introduced Nadia to the poet Nikolai across off an

325
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,530
enormously influential and beloved Russian writer who had died just a few years earlier.

326
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,870
Cross off. Did for Nadia what turned a Chesky had done for Lenin.

327
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,280
It was a passion, stirring moment of contact with something special and magical.

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,680
And right up until her death, it was no cross off who held pride of place in kripp Skye's

329
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,540
heart. And when she penned her own first political polemic, she opened it with one of his

330
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,970
lines. Vij locked his heart.

331
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,540
A woman's lot, a harder lot can scarce be found.

332
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,120
But knottiest summer in poetic bliss soon ended, the family moved onto St.

333
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,860
Petersburg and shortly thereafter she learned that this beloved teacher had been arrested

334
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,390
for owning subversive literature.

335
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,540
And I have no idea what happened to her.

336
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,470
After arriving in St. Petersburg, though, Nadia found another place to flourish.

337
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,990
The other Lonski gymnasium was a progressive school run by reformist liberals with deep

338
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:22,540
pocketed patrons with something resembling a permanent home after five years of itinerant

339
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,110
wandering. Not you made friends and started getting pretty good grades.

340
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,380
And it was during this period that she herself read Shawna Chayefsky.

341
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,880
Though it never hit her as hard as some of her contemporaries, including, of course, her

342
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,380
future husband. Her father's health had deteriorated under the strain of his

343
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,850
circumstances, though, and while he eventually did win his appeal after six years

344
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,390
persistent effort, it turns out he was wrongly disciplined.

345
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,600
It was too late to save his career and it was too late to save him.

346
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,200
He contracted tuberculosis and after a long period of wasting away, finally died in 1883

347
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,180
at the age of just 45.

348
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,840
Nadia and her mother were left alone and I hate to keep calling back to Lenin but Nadia

349
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,860
would never forgive the state for humiliating slandering and driving her father to ruin

350
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:18,420
and then to death. So this is all personal for her to the immediate circumstances for

351
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,860
mother and daughter were not terrible though it Lucy that was always able to get steady

352
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,210
work as a teacher and Nadia herself now picked up money tutoring and they live in a

353
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,140
respectable three room apartment solidly in sparsely.

354
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,820
Middle class eludes you about the continued to instill in her daughter a love of

355
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,350
education and a sense of social obligation to help and improve those around her

356
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:48,370
especially by passing her education along to others so eventually this mentality is going

357
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,920
to take her towards radical Marxist politics.

358
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,650
But Nadia Cribbs guy up took a bit of a detour through Tolstoy's and narco Christianity.

359
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,770
Now unfortunately we do not have the time nor do I have anything like a firm grasp on

360
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,810
Tolstoy's and Argo Christianity to delve too deep into this but luckily neither did

361
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:14,140
Nadia. She had no use for Tolstoy's evangelical beliefs his views on women or his disdain

362
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,940
for science. But she did like a lot of his other beliefs most especially his thoughts on

363
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:24,250
education which stressed spontaneity and curiosity and emotional connection over rigid

364
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,950
memorization and harsh disciplined.

365
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,480
Nadia admired Tolstoy enough that she wrote him what amounts to a fan letter and briefly

366
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,640
participated as a proofreader in a program that Tolstoy spearheaded to publish cheap

367
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,410
editions of great books and she edited an edition of The Count of Monte Cristo.

368
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,200
The possibility of using progressive education to improve the masses was alluring.

369
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,020
And by the time Nadia was 20.

370
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,130
It was poetry and literature and teaching gave direction to her ambitions about how she

371
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:59,380
could have an impact on the world once she graduated from gymnasium now.

372
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:05,070
Nadia arrived at her own famous conversion to Marx as a moment and every great Soviet

373
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,840
biography has to have a great conversion to Marx as a moment for Nadia.

374
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,300
This came in 1890 at the age of 21.

375
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,520
She joined a small radical discussion circle and after reading and delivering a report on

376
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,380
Lavrov historical letters she asked about these guys Marx and Engels she had been hearing

377
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,110
about and was given a small bundle of books to read.

378
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,500
Ironically though this bundle was selected by a comrade who happened to be into new road

379
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,050
ism and who hoped to prove to Nadia that Marx was full of beans.

380
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,600
So along with capital she got a critique of Marxism by an a rightist ideologue and a few

381
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,680
other books and even after the revolution Nadia admitted that reading the first two

382
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,840
chapters of Marx's Capital was like reading Greek and she had no background in economics

383
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,670
or philosophy or political science.

384
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,320
But she kept reading and got to the parts that talked about the conditions that the

385
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,090
workers had to endure and that did grab her and by the time she was done she believed

386
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,720
that Marx had effectively laid out an analysis of what was wrong with the world.

387
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,860
What could be done about it and most especially who was to blame.

388
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,630
And it was capitalism.

389
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,740
And in Russia the Tsar and in a straightforward way.

390
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:19,240
Nadia Cribbs Gaia accepted that they were the enemy and that she needed to spend her life

391
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:25,640
fighting them on a more practical level in 1891 she found her calling working as a night

392
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,790
school teacher in the very poor working class districts of St.

393
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,740
Petersburg teaching anything from basic literacy to math history literature and

394
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,710
geography. She loved the work and in 1893 she was elected director of the program by her

395
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:45,410
fellow teachers not given the nature of this work it should come as no surprise that most

396
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,620
of the faculty and administrators were reformist liberals.

397
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,160
A few of them were narrowest populists and a handful like Nadia were Marxists.

398
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,410
Now they could not use the classroom to organize politically but lessons could be steered

399
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,580
in certain directions.

400
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,220
And if a particular worker was interested in learning more than names and addresses could

401
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,830
be surreptitiously passed along Nadia's own education continued through this period as

402
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,920
she both had to learn additional materials to teach her students.

403
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,230
But she also learned from her students what their life was like who they were what their

404
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,600
problems were and it gave her invaluable insight and judgment insight that many of her

405
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,060
bourgeois radical comrades never quite grasped.

406
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,470
As many of them remain the kind of coffee house radicals who never met the people they

407
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,670
supposedly idolized and were fighting for now.

408
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,490
By this point Nadia and a few of her friends had moved into a Reading Circle headed by an

409
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,180
old in the protest turned Marxist name.

410
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,770
Step on red Janko and it was in this group that she first heard about this character

411
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:56,530
Vladimir. Ilya Juliano half brother of a hanged martyr who was bulldozing his way through

412
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:02,060
the radical debate circuit and then it was in this wrenching co group that they met for

413
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:08,500
the first time in February 1894 and it could not have been a more classic meet cute.

414
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,570
He read from passages from a book he was writing called what the friends of the people

415
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:19,550
are and how they fight the Social Democrats which was an anti-war protest track that

416
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,270
would be the first book published under the pen name Lenin.

417
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,860
No not yet that this was all fine.

418
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,690
But then after the reading he made a sarcastic jab about the value of teaching the

419
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,490
workers literature which was clearly a pointless fool's errand and which happened to be

420
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,170
her great passion in life.

421
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:42,500
So as we know from every romantic comedy ever written this awkward moment of initial off

422
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:49,110
putting behavior was only ever going to result in wedding bells but the wedding was still

423
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:54,480
a while off yet for the next few years Nadia and Vladimir would be merely comrades.

424
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,790
At this stage not fighting a war against the Tsar so much as against other radicals who

425
00:30:59,790 -->    04,890
were trying to pitch the wrong brand of revolution and so next week we will pick back up

426
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,360
with them as they hook up with another key player in the fight against revolutionary

427
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,580
Philistines Julius Martin.
