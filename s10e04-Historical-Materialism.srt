00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,190
This week's episode is brought to you by Harry's Harris founders were tired of paying up

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,710
for razors that were overpriced and overdesigned.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,180
They knew a great shave doesn't come from gimmicks like vibrating heads, flecks, balls or

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,680
handles that look like spaceships.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,070
Tactics that the leading brands have used to raise prices for decades.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,600
They fix that by combining a simple clean design with quality durable blades at a fair

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,320
price. Harry's replacement cartridges are just two dollars each.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,850
That's half the price of the Gillette Fusion pro shield.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,200
All Harry's blades come with 100 percent quality guarantee.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,740
And if you don't love your shave, let them know and they will give you a full refund.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,040
Mrs. Revolutions and I both continued to use our Harry's razors.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,270
We love the closeness of the shave, the look and feel of the handles and the precision

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,610
trim blade is great for cleaning up my hairline.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,670
So join me. And the 10 million others who have tried Harry's.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,180
Hello and welcome to revolutions.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,360
Apso 10.4

24
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,590
historical materialism.

25
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,030
One of my hobbies is studying historiography and the philosophy of history.

26
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,010
I don't like just studying history.

27
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,990
I like studying the history of history.

28
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,580
It's why, for example, the first appendices in the history of Rome was about the ancient

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,040
Greek and Latin historians.

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,930
I enjoyed the history of history in all of its medha glory.

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,460
And you can't really do the history of history without devoting a lot of space to the

32
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,990
Marxist historian graphic revolution, which opened up a whole new theoretical approach

33
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,540
that tied the course of history not to great ideas or great men or divine providence, but

34
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,830
rather to economics.

35
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,380
How a group of humans produces the material means of their biological survival.

36
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:20,200
Those base elements at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs food, drink, clothing,

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,230
shelter that is the base structure upon which the rest of the cultural superstructure is

38
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,310
built. Religion, arts, literature, politics, science.

39
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,240
All of it is rooted in how we produce the means of our survival.

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,760
And it is changes and conflicts in that base that determines the course of human history.

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,710
That is the basic premise of historical materialism and it is the subject of today's

42
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:51,870
episode. Starting in the 1840s, certainly no later than his arrival in Paris, Karl Marx

43
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,670
started considering the course of human history and what causal mechanisms might be at

44
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,220
work. He did this because he was beginning to conceive of a new kind of scientific

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,370
socialism and he wanted to put it on a solid foundation.

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,460
But because he had this fundamentally materialist philosophical outlook when Marx went

47
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,750
looking for these causal mechanisms, he did not plumb the depths of human reason like the

48
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,040
utopian socialist did.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,950
Instead, he studied economics and politics and the actual events of actual history going

50
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,060
back to the dawn of time.

51
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,420
Marks begins with the idea that the thing that makes humans different from animals is

52
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,600
that we come together to produce the means of our survival.

53
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,900
We don't just passively depend on what nature provides.

54
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,810
We actively produce the necessities of life.

55
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,900
We grow food, make shelter, weave cloth.

56
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,040
That's what makes humans human with this idea in mind.

57
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,090
Marks comes to believe that society is defined by the manner in which it does this

58
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,700
production. This is the stuff we talked about last week.

59
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,500
We're talking about the forces of production and the relations of production and more

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,540
specifically, the combination of those two concepts into the grand concept mode of

61
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,560
production, how a society produces its material needs.

62
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,710
This based mode of production is what defines all the other parts of a society's cultural

63
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,210
superstructure. As I just said, art, religion, philosophy, politics, science, forms of

64
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,290
media, everything.

65
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,240
And we can lump all of that stuff together and call it the ideology of the mode of

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,000
production. Now, though, Marx believes that the material base defines the cultural

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,430
ideology. He recognizes that it's a feedback loop between the base and the superstructure

68
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,250
and that each maintain and reinforce the other.

69
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,200
Just as the prevailing mode of production shapes legal, artistic and religious

70
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,260
institutions, the resulting law and art and religion serves to justify and maintain the

71
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,580
prevailing mode of production.

72
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,860
Now for Marks, the really frustrating part of this is that the organizing ideology of a

73
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,380
mode of production is always synonymous with the ideology of the ruling class in that

74
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,040
mode of production. So right and wrong, good and bad.

75
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,600
Who gets what and why?

76
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,700
Essentially, all the prevailing morality is the morality of the ruling class imposed on

77
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,800
everyone else, instilling in the exploited a set of beliefs designed to do little more

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,500
than rationalize the fact that they are being exploited.

79
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,920
And why? That's fine, actually.

80
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,270
The ruling ideology of a given era imprints itself and makes it seem like this is the way

81
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,160
it's always been and will always be.

82
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,080
Marx further believes that humans are fundamentally conservative creatures who prefer

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,020
routine habit and continuity to novelty and change, and that this social imprinting is

84
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,430
very difficult to undo.

85
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,630
But for Marx. History is progressive.

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,130
It moves in an evolutionary way from the simple to the complex.

87
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,620
It does change and grow and evolve.

88
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,550
So how then do we move from one mode of production to the next?

89
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,290
From small hunter-gatherer groups to walking around to these huge industrial cities

90
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:07,060
linked by railroads? Well, for Marx, it clearly comes down to changes in the means of

91
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,160
production. Right.

92
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,210
Those are the tools and the subjects of labor.

93
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,980
So we invent a better bow for hunting, maybe discover a technique for preserving food in

94
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,070
the winter. Learn how to domesticate some wild plant.

95
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,500
And this is fundamentally a concept that we would call the development of the productive

96
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,330
forces, which can partly be understood as a measure of human power over nature.

97
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,640
And if you survey human history, you can trace the development of our productive forces,

98
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,370
new tools, new techniques, new technologies lead to new ways of social organization, all

99
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,150
with the aim of producing more of the necessities of life more efficiently.

100
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,490
This can happen both slowly with refinement of technique, work and happen all at once

101
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,820
with some breakthrough discovery or invention.

102
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,360
But the tendency to develop the productive forces is clearly present.

103
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,200
Now, because he's working in a dialectical tradition, Marx sees things evolving through a

104
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,330
process of action and reaction.

105
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,070
And he has this theory that changes in the forces of production, developments in the

106
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,510
forces of production will ultimately seek to create new relations up production to

107
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,770
continue that development.

108
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,680
This is one of the underlying tensions in history.

109
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,080
What if the developing productive forces start slipping out from under the prevailing

110
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,670
ideological superstructure?

111
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,830
Put in another way, if the existing ideological and cultural superstructure starts to

112
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,390
become a hindrance to the further development of the forces of production, then we have a

113
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,740
major problem on our hands.

114
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,090
And society is either headed for revolution or complete social collapse.

115
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,930
When this happens, the inhibited forces of production will of necessity burst asunder, as

116
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,430
Marx likes to put it, and reorganize as a new mode of production better suited to

117
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,010
continue the development of the productive forces.

118
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,230
Marx thinks that these moments of revolution or social collapse occur when a society is

119
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,280
ready to transition from one overarching mode of production to its successor.

120
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,410
And as Mark says in the German ideology and I'm quoting here, at a certain stage of

121
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,360
development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the

122
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,430
existing relations up production from forms of development of the productive forces.

123
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,100
These relations turn into their fetters.

124
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,550
Then begins an era of social revolution and quote, to use metaphors, invoking industrial

125
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,750
imagery than revolution is thus the motor force of history.

126
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,220
One of the most important tensions and contradictions that exist in a society is how the

127
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,140
development of these forces up production produce different classes that are defined by

128
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,080
who is doing the labor and who is reaping the rewards.

129
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,740
Who is the laboring class and who is the ruling class?

130
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,440
Who is the oppressor and who is the oppressed?

131
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,570
Now the development of the ruling class, freed from the drudgery of manual labor to

132
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,700
produce the necessities of life is not just how we come to have lords and priests who

133
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,100
were the first two groups to say No, actually, you work.

134
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,450
I'll just be over here, chairman.

135
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,510
It also brings us all the things we associate with that cultural superstructure art,

136
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,570
music, philosophy, science, sports, all of it.

137
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,910
But for nearly all of human history, the production of culture, as we understand it, has

138
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,920
been the province of a small minority inside or adjacent to the ruling class who do not

139
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,210
have the labor to survive.

140
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,280
And this tension between the laborers and the non labourers, between the oppressed and

141
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,560
the oppressors, will naturally create tension, class conflict and class struggle.

142
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,370
And that class conflict is central to the course of history.

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,250
Marx opened the Communist Manifesto by stating boldly The history of all Hitler to

144
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,670
existing society is the history of class struggles.

145
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,820
And then he goes on to say, Freemen and slave, patrician and plebeian, Lord and Serf

146
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,530
Guild, master and journeyman.

147
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,230
In a word, oppressor and oppressed stood in constant opposition to one another, carried

148
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,800
on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended either in a

149
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,950
revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending

150
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,610
classes. Now, I am leaving a lot of nuance out of this.

151
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,500
But before we move on, I want to say that Marx does not think human beings are mere

152
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,850
passengers in history.

153
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,830
They are not carried along by some mystical force of history outside of free will.

154
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,750
And this makes sense for a guy like Marx, who is at heart a passionate, energetic,

155
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,140
revolutionary activist who doesn't want to just interpret the world.

156
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,490
He wants to change it.

157
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,430
And so though sometimes he gets carried away and uses phrases like inevitable to describe

158
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,720
the triumph of the working class.

159
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,460
He doesn't actually think this, but he does believe that the conditions within which

160
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,180
humans live at any given moment limit the scope of available action.

161
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,600
Individual humans are rooted in history.

162
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,790
Early hunter-gatherers could not invent capitalism because the technological level of

163
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,980
their means of production simply did not allow it.

164
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,780
It was impossible for the levellers and the diggers to usher in communism during the

165
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,190
English Revolution because the mode of production and level of technology did not allow

166
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,090
it. And Marx sum this up, and I heartily endorse this sentiment.

167
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,000
By the way, he says this in the 18th premiere of Louis Bonaparte.

168
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,290
Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please.

169
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:36,660
They do not make it under self selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing,

170
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,930
already given and transmitted from the past, the tradition of all dead generations, ways

171
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,940
like an ALP on the brains of the living.

172
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,400
And that is a million percent true.

173
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:55,810
So we will now move on to the stages of historical materialism, Mark's divided the eras

174
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,050
of human history up by their prevailing mode of production.

175
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,130
And he was here working in the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment tradition.

176
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,900
The Scottish Enlightenment guys like Adam Smith had come up with their own progressive

177
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,900
stages of economic development and defined them as hunting pasturage, agriculture and

178
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:19,210
commerce. And so Marx has his own version of this to keep things simple.

179
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,720
I will keep it restricted to what is now the accepted canon.

180
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,780
First, tribal or primitive communism than ancient or slave mode of production.

181
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,200
Then the feudal mode of production than the capitalist mode of production.

182
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,540
And finally, the socialist mode of production.

183
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,390
There are slightly modified versions of this that involve an AC ADIC mode and a barbarian

184
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,380
mode that exists in the area between the tribal and the ancient motive productions.

185
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,220
But I will set those aside for now.

186
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,400
The basic questions we are going to be asking ourselves are what are the means of

187
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,910
production? Who owned or controls the means of production?

188
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,740
What are the relations of production that surround and enable those means?

189
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,260
Whereas the surplus production going.

190
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,150
What is the class conflict?

191
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,670
How are the forces of production being developed?

192
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,530
Those are the fundamental questions.

193
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,330
And I should stress, though, before we get into this, that Marx never really grappled

194
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,740
with East Asian or South Asian history, and he gets pretty fuzzy about everything the

195
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,870
further you get from, say, the Rhine River.

196
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,450
And so what follows amounts to mostly an accounting of European history from pre-history.

197
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:32,260
OK, so we begin with primitive communism or the tribal mode of production or as it is

198
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,750
commonly known, hunter gatherer society.

199
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,000
Now the first thing we should say is that for the materialist historian, the big thing

200
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,400
that advances Proteau humans beyond their initial animal state is not that they had big

201
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,640
brains, but instead that they decided to adopt bipedal locomotion which freed up their

202
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,810
hands to use tools.

203
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,900
And that is what allowed their brains to grow big and smart.

204
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,710
Remember, always material development first ideas.

205
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,790
Second, you can disagree with that.

206
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,520
But this is what the materialists say.

207
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,290
The other big things humans have going for them is cooperative labor.

208
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,320
We always find humans working in groups together.

209
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,390
So those early, modern and enlightenment era depictions of man as a solitary creature in

210
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,380
the state of nature that you find in like Rousseau and Locke and Hobbs, that is all

211
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,140
wrong. Humans were never solitary creatures.

212
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,970
We were always in groups.

213
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,560
Sharing and cooperative dependence are the essential survival skills of the human

214
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,290
species, not self-reliance and independence.

215
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,110
So the means of production in this first mode are just rudimentary tools and available

216
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,160
natural resources.

217
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,550
So axes and spears, baskets, knives, they tame fire where simple animal skin clothing.

218
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,540
They live in rudimentary shelter and both the means of production and the production

219
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,790
itself is shared in common by the group.

220
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,730
The relations of production are kinship groups with a loose and fluid division of

221
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,790
hunter-gatherer labor without a great deal of specialization and sense.

222
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,640
This is a very hand-to-mouth existence.

223
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,470
There is no surplus to cream off that would allow a non laboring life.

224
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,760
So everyone is working.

225
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,500
This means there is no class.

226
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,390
There is no state. Property.

227
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,110
Money. Kings. Aristocrats.

228
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,590
Any of that stuff. There was no class.

229
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,150
And so there was no class conflict.

230
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,290
And the forces of production basically stayed the same.

231
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,070
That is, they were not developing for hundreds of thousands of years for the majority of

232
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,750
human existence. I mean, just by sheer number of years, this primitive communist mode of

233
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,450
production has been the prevailing mode of production.

234
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,430
Then about ten or twelve thousand years ago, give or take, human society underwent what

235
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,980
has been dubbed the Neolithic revolution.

236
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,390
This is when the ancient aliens came down from the heavens, messed with our DNA and

237
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,680
taught us how to be farmers.

238
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,710
The forces of production developed from hunting and gathering to settled agriculture and

239
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:01,260
animal husbandry. Our new found ability to domesticate plants and animals to produce the

240
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,560
necessities of life changed how and where humans lived.

241
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,670
This material change altered our social relations.

242
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,350
Some societies stopped being nomadic and started to live in permanent settlements.

243
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,620
Harnessing the productive power of farming also introduced a truly transformative element

244
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,680
surpluses. These societies could produce so much food that some people didn't have to

245
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,600
devote themselves to productive labor.

246
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,300
So we have the origins of class between a laboring majority and a non laboring minority.

247
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,210
This non laboring minority becomes the ruling class who initially, through sheer physical

248
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,900
intimidation, are able to command and control the surplus production.

249
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,720
The free time of this non laboring ruling class allowed for even greater developments in

250
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,220
the productive forces, but also everything else we think of as culture.

251
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,210
All the elements of what we now call civilization become present.

252
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,190
As a result of surpluses.

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,680
So this Neolithic revolution is arguably the single most important event in human

254
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,040
history. This revolution takes us from the tribal or primitive communist mode of

255
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,260
production to the ancient or slave mode of production, which at its highest state is

256
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,970
basically synonymous with Greco Roman civilization.

257
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,840
The means of production now include large scale settled agriculture, the extensive use of

258
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:30,090
animals for power, the beginnings of industry, mining and craft work in cities and

259
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,430
advanced large scale trade networks.

260
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,550
We also have the arrival of legal private property.

261
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,500
This field is mine, not yours.

262
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,630
And because we now have a surplus that can be allotted to a non laboring ruling class, we

263
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,440
also have advancements in the cultural superstructure, the development of the

264
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,750
intellectual means of production, writing, cataloging, archiving, math calendars,

265
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,580
science, weights and measures, all of which will be handled by a new professional class

266
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,350
engineers, lawyers, architects, traders, artisans, musicians, actors and teachers.

267
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,160
Real permanent specialization of labor starts to set in.

268
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,740
But the defining feature of the ancient mode of production is the arrival of the slave.

269
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,710
With warfare now a much larger scale proposition, captured prisoners can be brought home

270
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,470
and put to work. Get them not us to do the productive labor for marks.

271
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,550
The defining class division then in the ancient mode of production, is not necessarily

272
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,720
between ruler and ruled, but between free individual and slave.

273
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,850
And it's these free individuals who are gobbling up the surplus created by the laboring

274
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,620
class of slaves who were the private property of another human being, no less than the

275
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,730
hammer or the skies.

276
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,100
Now, this is a very general depiction of like a thousand years or more of Mediterranean

277
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,240
history with the ancient mode of production, again, just sort of being a picture in the

278
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,640
mind's eye of a timeless Roman Empire.

279
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,950
Now, from the materialist perspective, the big thing that wrecked the ancient mode of

280
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,040
production was the decrease in supply of cheap slaves from about the end of the Punic

281
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,830
Wars up through the disaster in the Tuta Burg Forest.

282
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,660
The Roman legions steadily expanded Rome's borders and its population of slaves.

283
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,000
But after this, the Roman Empire stopped expanding, aside from a few side projects and

284
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,320
the ambitions of Trajan.

285
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,540
This meant that slaves became dearer and more expensive, and eventually it's going to

286
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,000
make sense to stop using slaves and start using again some version of non owned people.

287
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:36,140
When this happens, the transition from slave society to feudal society oh so

288
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,550
imperceptibly began.

289
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:42,640
Now, we actually mapped a lot of this transition out during the history of Rome, right,

290
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,840
starting with the crisis of the third century.

291
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,910
The large, broad and safe empire started to become internally isolated.

292
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,320
Big walls along the frontiers were replaced by walls around cities.

293
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,060
The inability of the central government to guarantee safety raise the power of local

294
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,370
nobles. Labor was willing to send its surplus not to some central state bureaucracy, but

295
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,070
to the local lord who promised to actually defend them.

296
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,160
And this is the origins of Lord and serf.

297
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,550
State taxes levied on commerce by the later emperors tended to make those rising feudal

298
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,480
lords say, Well, screw it, I'll just make it myself rather than buying it on the open

299
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,050
market. And this developed internal self-sufficiency.

300
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,510
All of this makes late antiquity a great transition phase from the ancient mode of

301
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,550
production to the feudal mode of production.

302
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,850
But this is not accompanied by a revolutionary reconstruction of society at large, but

303
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,050
rather this other thing, the common ruin of the contending classes.

304
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,700
In this case, the ancient mode of production was tottering and decrepit.

305
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,870
And when the great migrations came through, they swept aside the Roman Empire.

306
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,080
And what was left was those Proteau feudal relations.

307
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,740
According to historical materialism, this switch from the ancient to the feudal mode of

308
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,090
production was a regression for society.

309
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,400
It was a step back.

310
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,160
The forces of production were still defined by agriculture manual and animal labor with

311
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,740
some technological help from things like water mills.

312
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,330
But the technological level went backwards or at the very least did not advance.

313
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,100
And this is also not happening in a huge linked together empire of trade and

314
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,860
distribution, but rather local self-sufficiency.

315
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,720
And more importantly, most importantly, perhaps, the slaves were now gone.

316
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,210
They were replaced by serfs out in the field, ostensibly non owned individuals who were

317
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,280
nonetheless legally bound to the land.

318
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,320
And this is the fundamental class antagonism during the feudal mode of production between

319
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,550
the productive serfs and the non laboring nobility in the cities.

320
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,290
Crafts were made by free artisans who eventually organized themselves into guilds.

321
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,890
The surplus went to the new class of feudal nobles.

322
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,780
The cast of warrior families who entered into complex reciprocal contracts with each

323
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,500
other and claimed most of the land for themselves.

324
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,670
But it is important to note that in the feudal mode of production, the artisan owned all

325
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:12,500
his own tools, the means of production, and thus the products of his labor and the

326
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,730
peasant. While they had to give some designated portion of the produce of their land to

327
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,490
the local Lord, the rest was theirs to live on.

328
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:25,580
There was a direct relationship between the labor invested and the produce consumed for a

329
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,090
long time. The forces of production were not really developing at all.

330
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,050
In fact, they were producing less than the Roman Empire had at its height.

331
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,210
And this went on for a thousand years around these feudal forces of production came on

332
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,130
monotheistic Catholic church and a hierarchical monarchy with divinely ordained kings

333
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,260
that preached a timeless chain of being.

334
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,000
But around about thirteen hundred, something started to happen.

335
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,940
Most probably rocketed forward by the Black Death, which swept through Europe and killed

336
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,140
a third of the population.

337
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,300
Suddenly, the oppressed peasants could demand better pay and conditions and terms of

338
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,730
service. Land that had previously been owned by people who were dead were claimed by

339
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:12,200
people who were living, growing their landholdings and creating something like a wealthy

340
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,660
peasant class or an emerging gentry in the cities.

341
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,240
The merchants and traders were able to assert more autonomy and weight against the land

342
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,860
based feudal aristocracy.

343
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,390
And these guys were the Bergers, basically the urban oligarchs.

344
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:32,750
And it is from that title Burgher that Marx dubs them the bourgeoisie, a class that was

345
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,070
destined to develop the forces of production more than any other group since at least the

346
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,030
ancient aliens who taught us how to farm by the 14 hundreds.

347
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,410
You start getting real developments in modern banking techniques of pooling and investing

348
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,200
and lending capital. The printing press is invented.

349
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,970
Then the Americas were discovered.

350
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,380
The whole world was discovered.

351
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,210
Constantinople fell in.

352
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,830
Islamic civilization was pushed out of Spain, leading to European rediscovery of ancient

353
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,840
philosophy and knowledge on a wide scale.

354
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,750
So inside late feudalism, the forces of production began to change.

355
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,420
Industry started to become larger, more co-operative and more centralized.

356
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,170
The old guild system came under pressure from larger scale investments based off of

357
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:20,300
pooled capital, and the historical role of capitalism was to concentrate all the

358
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,650
scattered means of production spread out across a bunch of mostly self-sufficient local

359
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,740
regions and start producing goods on a massive scale.

360
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,980
This goes hand-in-hand with a change in mentality.

361
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:37,190
Production now is not just for use, but for sale in a consumer economy, and that sale was

362
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,880
meant to create a monetary profit for the capitalist investor.

363
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,890
Now, of course, people had always produced things that people need, but this was taken to

364
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,240
a whole different level.

365
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,520
And a consumer economy organized around profitable commodities produced on a heretofore

366
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,830
unimaginable scale was born.

367
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,230
The old feudal culture was replaced by new concepts, rationalisation of processes,

368
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,300
training, efficiency and discipline.

369
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,890
The division of industrial labor that is the production of goods rather than just food

370
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,200
had mostly been between guilds.

371
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,790
As in you make shoes.

372
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,920
I do hats. This was replaced by a division of labor inside the shop itself.

373
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,470
You cut leather, I pound nails.

374
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,510
We can make way more stuff.

375
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,950
So this is clearly a major development for the forces up production, but it was running

376
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,640
up against a feudal system that was not fit for this next stage of development.

377
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,390
And just to take one example, serfdom was tying people to the land.

378
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,530
And so they weren't allowed to move to the cities to become workers or you have archaic

379
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,700
tax and tariff systems that inhibited the free movement of mass produced goods.

380
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,320
So this brings us basically to the beginning of the revolutions podcast, because in the

381
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,550
historical materialist conception, the English Revolution and the French Revolution are

382
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,650
both major bourgeois revolutions.

383
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,060
The forces unleashed by the bourgeoisie bursting asunder against the old feudal

384
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:04,030
aristocracy or, if you like, the new capitalist base trying to shake off a now thoroughly

385
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:09,250
ill fitting feudal superstructure to build a capitalist society on top of the capitalist

386
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,300
forces of production.

387
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,610
Now in France, things were set back a bit by the fall of Napoleon, but the July

388
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,560
revolution 15 years later was explicitly and nakedly a bourgeois revolution.

389
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,270
There's a quote from Jacques Le Ft.

390
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,910
He says, Now the bankers will rule.

391
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,090
So we talked about some of the hallmarks of the capitalist mode of production last week.

392
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,370
Labor has now been collected and socialized, but the means of production, the tools, the

393
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,870
natural resources and eventually the factories are owned by a single individual or a

394
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,550
small collection of investors who claim all the profit from the commodities produced.

395
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,430
And everything is now organized around the principle of producing commodities for profit

396
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:56,530
and more specifically, exploiting labor to extract profit from the produce of that

397
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:02,500
exploited labor. And as Mark sees it, this upend the intuitive old style of market

398
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,570
economics where you sell a commodity to get some money so that you can go buy a different

399
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,790
commodity that you need but do not have.

400
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,440
So you make a table, sell it for money so you can go buy some clothes.

401
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,090
Under capitalism, there's a new version where you take your money.

402
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,500
Use it to make a product so you can sell that product to get more money.

403
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,420
And this whole new conception of reality starts to attach itself to everything and

404
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,190
everything becomes abstracted into a commodity that can be bought and sold inside the

405
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,390
market, and the market used to be just this ancillary piece of society.

406
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,820
And now it's the whole obsessive focus.

407
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,860
No one, certainly not the historical materialist, denies the results.

408
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,870
Once unleashed, the capitalist mode of production, advance the productive forces further

409
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,180
than all of human history put together.

410
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,720
It is practically as significant as the Neolithic revolution.

411
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,930
This new mode of production created a fundamentally new class struggle, no longer between

412
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,500
the noble and the surf, but between the capitalist and the worker, between the

413
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,480
bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

414
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:15,780
A new class of laborers who own nothing and can only sell their labor for wages and the

415
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,070
etymology of proletariat.

416
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,590
Just so you know comes from an old Roman census designation for a landless citizen who

417
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:27,720
fell well short of all property qualifications for real citizenship and participation in

418
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,660
civil society. Now, as we discussed two episodes back, Marx, the young revolutionary,

419
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,630
identified a restrained bourgeois class that was both suffering under the fetters of

420
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:45,210
feudalism and who had unique power thanks to their position inside the developing forces

421
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,610
up production to stage a revolution.

422
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,980
They were the revolutionary class, and when he went looking for a group that fit these

423
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,080
parameters inside the new capitalist mode of production, he landed on this previously

424
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,880
unidentified and unknown.

425
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,400
Working class, the proletariat, their misery and exploitation was such that they would

426
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,620
desire revolutionary emancipation and their proximity to and position within the new

427
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,300
capitalist means of production.

428
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,820
Place them in a unique position to have a real revolutionary impact on the economic base

429
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:23,580
of society. And Marx further believed that these proletarian forces, the forces that

430
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,780
would destroy the bourgeoisie, had been summoned by the bourgeoisie themselves.

431
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,700
That, like the Sorcerer's Apprentice, they had conjured forces they could not control.

432
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,760
And in the end, the bourgeoisie ultimately produced above all their own grave diggers.

433
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:46,360
Now, when the proletariat overthrew the bourgeoisie, it would usher in a new socialist

434
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,410
mode of production.

435
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:54,040
Now, I will say, though, that both Marx and Ingles are very vague and cagey about what

436
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,740
this new socialist mode of production will look like.

437
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,770
And partly this is because they don't want to be dreamy utopians building castles in the

438
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:08,110
sky, but they do think that something is going to happen and that it will be socialism.

439
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:14,650
They hint that it will probably unfold in two stages, a lower transitionary phase and a

440
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,570
higher stage. And this is sometimes divided between socialism and then full communism.

441
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,770
But Marx often just uses the terms lower and higher socialism.

442
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,140
In this new mode of production, the means of production will be owned by the workers

443
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,820
themselves. They will be the beneficiaries of their own labor rather than seeing it

444
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,900
creamed off and hoarded by a small minority of exploitive rulers.

445
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,150
He also thinks that this will bring about the end of all class distinctions which dated

446
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,440
back to the dawn of agriculture since the Neolithic revolution.

447
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,720
Every mode of production has been dominated by a minority ruling class living off the

448
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,970
produce of a majority laboring class.

449
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:00,220
Now that this has been upended with the majority laboring class, now the new ruling

450
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,630
class, all class distinctions will evaporate because there will be no more oppressor and

451
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,750
no more oppressed. All of the surplus will be shared in common.

452
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,540
In fact, there will be such an abundance.

453
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:15,820
Thanks to the productive powers consolidated during the capitalist mode of production, a

454
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,500
post-scarcity society will not require oppressor or oppressed and all becomes irrelevant.

455
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,170
Who's fighting for control of the necessities of life?

456
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,250
They are in abundance.

457
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,630
Everyone can share.

458
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,890
From each according to their abilities and to each according to their needs.

459
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,180
So that is the materialist conception of history and that is the trajectory that Karl

460
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,430
Marx believes human civilization is on.

461
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:45,340
And this is going to be picked up by his successors because Marx has sketched out an idea

462
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,530
that by necessity, the working class proletariat and only the working class proletariat

463
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,300
is the revolutionary class.

464
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,670
And that in the transition phase between capitalism and socialism, they are going to have

465
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:04,150
to seize revolutionary power and impose what Marx problematically dubbed the dictatorship

466
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,200
of the proletariat.

467
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:10,780
And so next week we are going to set Marx aside and we are going to turn to the

468
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,250
philosophy of people who rejected all of that, who thought that this was not the stuff of

469
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,680
emancipation, but the stuff of further tyranny.

470
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:22,840
And just as we did with Marx and Angles next week, we will cover the life and times of

471
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,520
Mikhail Bakunin, their ideological opponent in the battle for control of the first

472
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,630
international and further revolutionary future of all of Europe.

473
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,080
I will end, though, by reminding everybody that I will be at the Intelligent Speech

474
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,130
Conference in New York on June the twenty ninth, a bunch of us podcasters will be there.

475
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,900
You can beat us. We can hang out all day.

476
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,590
I will be doing a presentation called What is the Point of all this?

477
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,730
And then later in the day, I'll sit for a roundtable discussion about whatever we decide

478
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,960
to roundtable discuss.

479
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,530
It is going to be great and I very much hope to see you there.
