00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,710
This week's episode is brought to you by Casper Casper is a sleep brand that makes

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,620
expertly designed products to help you get your best rest.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,610
One night at a time, you spend one third of your life sleeping, so you should be

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,050
comfortable. The experts at Casper worked tirelessly to make quality sleep surfaces that

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,930
cradle your natural geometry and all the right places.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,490
The original Casper Mattress combined multiple supportive memory foams for a quality

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,790
sleep surface with the right amount to both sync and bounce.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,950
But Casper now offers three other mattresses the wave, the essential and the hybrid.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,330
And prices are affordable because Casper cuts out the middleman and sells directly to

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,380
you. And that includes free shipping and returns in the United States and Canada.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,850
And you can be sure of your purchase with Kasper's hundred night risk free sleep on it

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,020
trial. The Duncan family still heartily endorses the Casper mattress and pillows.

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,700
Many great naps and good night sleeps were taken thanks to Casper was a great comfortable

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,380

Hello and welcome to revolutions.

20
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,700
Episode ten point twenty four The Union of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:39,060
Class. Last time we introduced Julius Markoff and a new theory of organizing for the

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,000
Russian Marxist agitation, not propaganda, which Markoff would then carry with him to St.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,470
Petersburg when his two years administrative exile in Vilna finally wrapped up in the

24
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,940
autumn of 1895.

25
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,370
In today's episode, he will arrive bearing this new strategy and then join with other

26
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,080
Marxists in the capital to form a new group who would agitate their way towards the

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,460
revolution they all dreamed of.

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,130
Now, one of Marta's key allies in this project is going to, of course, be Lenin.

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,540
And it is in the course of today's episode that these two future friends turned future

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,550
rivals. We'll meet for the first time.

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,820
So what has Lenin been up to?

32
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,640
Well, while Mahtob was trumpeting the success of the new program of agitation to his

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,270
comrades in Vilna in May of 1895, Lenin was off on his first trip abroad on a mission he

34
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,700
undertook on behalf of his comrades in St.

35
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,220
Petersburg to make contact with the now legendary old guard emigre Marxists of the

36
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,690
Emancipation of Labor Group.

37
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,670
Our old friends Grigori Farhana, various sulik and Pavel Axlerod.

38
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,120
When Lenin submitted his travel paperwork to the authorities, he claimed that this was a

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,680
vacation he undertook for his health, which wasn't totally made up.

40
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,510
He had been very sick in April of 1895 and did actually need to recuperate.

41
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,560
But the authorities didn't really care whether it was a lie or not.

42
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,090
Lenin was well-known to them and they happily stamped his papers to get him out of the

43
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,340
country because maybe if they were lucky, he would just decide to never come back, which

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,630
would be all right with them.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,610
So in the last week of April 1895, Lenin departed on what would be a four month tour

46
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,790
through Austria, Germany, Switzerland and France.

47
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,040
His most important object being linking up with the emancipation of labor group.

48
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,770
Now, he left this group back in episode ten point seventeen around about 1890.

49
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,380
And I wrapped up episode ten point seventeen by saying and I'm quoting myself now, It's

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,600
fair to say that by the dawn of 1890, the emancipation of Labor Group had zero influence

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,030
on socialist politics at home or abroad.

52
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,860
But much to everyone's shock, the forces of history turned in their favor.

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,110
on/off suddenly appeared to be a mad prophet who had predicted a great flood and who

54
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,910
everyone had laughed at until the flood suddenly came and quote.

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,370
So having spent the 1880s publishing their interpretations and translation of Marx into

56
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,230
the void, the Vitesse system had come along and made Marxism suddenly very relevant to

57
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,770
this younger generation like Lenin and Crips Gaia and Ma Tof.

58
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,870
Not that the emancipation of labor group yet had any formal ties to any distributors or

59
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,340
allies inside of Russia.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,840
Their work was smuggled in and passed around, but it was all very haphazard.

61
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,850
Like the kids who would go on holiday with their families and come home with trunks full

62
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,950
of illegal books, these books would then be passed around hand to hand inside of reading

63
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,090
and discussion circles.

64
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,510
But there was no permanent stable distribution link.

65
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,220
One of the reasons Lenin was undertaking his mission to find the emancipation of labor

66
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,590
group was to forge just such a permanent, stable distribution link between Switzerland

67
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:02,440
and Russia. So even as late as 1895, the emancipation of labor group was still just as

68
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,000
small as they had always been.

69
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,680
It was still just the three of them, Kahana, sulik and Axlerod.

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,510
And this is not to say they could not have built a larger organization inside the emigre

71
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,160
community had they wanted to.

72
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,260
They just did not want to.

73
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,890
The triumvirate of Tarnoff, sulik and Axlerod conceived of the Emancipation of Labour

74
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,860
Group as a close knit intellectual brain trust that must remain compact in order to

75
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,640
maintain ideological coherence and purity, coherence and purity as defined mostly by

76
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,610
plant. So they were happy to meet with potential supporters or followers or people who

77
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,020
might like to spread their work.

78
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,710
But they were never going to offer you membership in the group.

79
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,840
And one way to think about this is that they basically conceived of themselves as

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,960
something like a modern rock band cranking out albums.

81
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,000
If you like a band, you support the band, you go to their concert, you buy their albums

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,100
and tell your friends. But just because you like a band doesn't mean you get to join the

83
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,900
band. But young radicals at the time didn't really have any concept of this.

84
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,490
Being invited to join parties and circles in groups was a fairly normal thing.

85
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,380
So it often came as a disappointing shock to fans who came round up Cohon off being like,

86
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,880
Oh man, I dig your stuff.

87
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,310
Where can I sign up and plan off?

88
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,370
Would say, Hey, great bison books spread the word.

89
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,520
But no, you don't get to join the band.

90
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,290
And then they would leave and he would go back to writing.

91
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,350
Now there are pluses and minuses to this approach.

92
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,970
But for sure, the biggest plus, at least in part on OFT's mind, was that he never had to

93
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,280
share songwriting duties with anyone.

94
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,920
Is it time for me to let this metaphor go?

95
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,410
Yes, it is time for me to let this metaphor go.

96
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:56,400
You get it. While they were busy not expanding their ranks in the early 1890s, Kahana was

97
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,740
hard at work on what became one of his most important books the development of the most

98
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,680
view of history, which was meant to be the definitive articulation of historical

99
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,240
materialism for a Russian audience written under a pseudonym.

100
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,090
The title, The Development of the Most View of History was intentionally designed to be

101
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,260
unwieldy and boring, to hopefully slip it past the censors.

102
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,680
And it worked just as they had done with capital.

103
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,210
The bureaucrats and the censors office decided the development of the modest view of

104
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,680
history was a snooze fast.

105
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,030
And they let it be published legally in Russia once it started making the rounds.

106
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,460
Though it turned out to be a real hit, the most view became the basic textbook

107
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,740
explanation for historical materialism, leaving readers with a clear argument why the

108
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,750
Marxists were so focused on this growing urban proletariat as the key to the future

109
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,860
socialist revolution.

110
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,600
And it turned out to be a must read for all budding socialist revolutionaries.

111
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,830
One of those budding socialist revolutionaries was, of course, Lenin.

112
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:10,420
And a 25 year old Lenin arrived in Switzerland in May of 1895, moderately intimidated by

113
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,620
the prospect of meeting the great plan' off the Moses of Marxism, Farhana.

114
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,320
For his part, seems to have appreciated Lenin's appreciation of his work.

115
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,000
At least once it became clear that Lenin did not want to, like join the band.

116
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,730
Lenin was instead offering his services as a representative of supporters inside Russia

117
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,050
who could help spread the ideas up on often the other members of the Emancipation of

118
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:40,360
Labor Group. And this was the perfect moment to really flood the intellectual market with

119
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,100
Marxism because the Vita's system was in full swing by this point, which really did seem

120
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,310
to be proving that Marx and historical materialism were dead.

121
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,040
Right. So on/off and Lenin worked out an arrangement in principle, and Lenin departed

122
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,360
with a stack of letters of introduction written by on/off that would open doors for young

123
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,410
Lenin throughout Europe.

124
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,210
And though in the future they were almost never in the same place at the same time.

125
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,820
Lenin and Klawonn Off would spend the next 10 years or so basically on the same side.

126
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,620
So this meeting in May of 1895 was the beginning of an effective partnership.

127
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,990
But please, Tarnoff also recognized in Lenin something that Lenin probably recognized in

128
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,900
himself, already a potential rival for the title leader of the Russian Marxist.

129
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,350
This concern was deepened a little bit when Lennon moved along to Zurich to stay for a

130
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,190
week with Pavel Axelrod and Axelrod straight upset.

131
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,180
I think we found our leader in Russia.

132
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,260
So Lennon and Axlerod hung out for about a week and got to know each other.

133
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,410
They read and discussed various articles and books and ideas.

134
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,390
And Lennon was very pleased when Axlerod commented on a collection of articles Lennon had

135
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,860
brought with him, saying that he'd like one in particular, which just so happened to be

136
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,410
the one written by Lennon under another pen name.

137
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,600
They also discussed the role and relationship of those revolutionaries inside Russia to

138
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,100
those outside Russia.

139
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,990
And they agreed that when the revolution came that the centre of leadership had to be

140
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,430
inside Russia.

141
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
That the best way for emigre outfits like the Emancipation of Labour Group to help the

142
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,080
revolution would be, as Axelrod put it, to act as a fortified redoubt overlooking a great

143
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,850
battlefield. They would be able to take in the whole picture, give strategic advice and

144
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,680
protect the most precious valuables.

145
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,020
Axelrod did not really agree with many of his fellow emigres, who, in their kind of

146
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,700
arrogant and insular myopia, believe that the people inside Russia should be the foot

147
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,700
soldiers, while the emigres should be the generals.

148
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,460
Axelrod thought this was kind of crazy.

149
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,710
If nothing else, it was a supremely inefficient way to run a revolution, which is almost,

150
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,390
by its very nature, a rapid fire event that will require instantaneous decision making on

151
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,210
the ground. Lenin agreed wholeheartedly.

152
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,890
So agreed on this point.

153
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,750
Lenin departed, and it would come as a bit of a shock to Axelrod to find Lenin making the

154
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,850
opposite case just a few years later.

155
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,800
Of course, that was after Lenin had been driven into exile himself, which I'm sure had

156
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,650
nothing to do with his change of heart.

157
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,470
After his stay in Switzerland, Lennon moved on to parents where he met with other emigre

158
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,420
radicals. The most important of these audiences being with the legendary Frenchman Paul

159
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,010
Lafarge, the veteran of the Paris commune who had fled to London in the aftermath of the

160
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,290
bloody week and who soon thereafter married Karl Marx, his daughter Laura, sitting there

161
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,550
with this commu Nahed and the daughter of Marx, Lenin listened to their stories with rapt

162
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,450
attention, and the pair's commun in particular would be a historical event.

163
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,970
He would often return to in his own writings.

164
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,210
Aside from this meeting, Lennon enjoyed his time in Paris as best he could, though his

165
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,950
health did start to deteriorate.

166
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,260
He suffered headaches and insomnia, and eventually he had to make his declaration to the

167
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,990
Russian authorities that he was travelling abroad for his health.

168
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,180
True, with an infusion of cash from his always supportive mother, Lennon returned to

169
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,110
Switzerland, where he recuperated at a spa before heading back to the battlefield in

170
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,280
Russia. Lennon returned to St.

171
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,560
Petersburg in early September 1895.

172
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,460
Looking forward to implementing a program he had discussed with the Emancipation of

173
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,550
Labour Group, linking together the 20 or so currently separate Marxist reading circles in

174
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:25,530
and around St. Petersburg and then linking that linked group to the emigres abroad.

175
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,970
It was going to be the beginnings of the beginnings of a Social Democratic Party.

176
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:38,830
Maybe. It was in the service of this project that Lenin first met Ma Tof, who returned

177
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,890
from his exile in October of 1895, bearing the new gospel of the Vilna program and eager

178
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,420
to make it work in St. Petersburg.

179
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,860
Now, up until now, Lenin himself had mostly been doing polemical work against the

180
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,330
Philistine protists, who could not see that they were the past in Marxism was the future.

181
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,850
He had also done some propagandizing among the workers, though he didn't really enjoy it.

182
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,080
He was a writer, a debater and a leader, not a schoolteacher.

183
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,230
So, though he did enjoy the intellectually stimulating life of a salon radical.

184
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,120
He saw in the Vilna program a straightforward way to advance the revolutionary character

185
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,860
of the working classes, because in the end the working classes were going to be expected

186
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,850
to do their revolutionary work as a class, as a mass movement.

187
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,060
This was not supposed to be about an elite intellectual vanguard.

188
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,610
Lenin agreed that focusing on specific factory grievances would help show the workers

189
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,440
living examples of the theory of the exploitation of labor outlined by Marx.

190
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,680
Lenin also agreed that prodding the workers towards strikes by socialist agitation would

191
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,930
give those workers necessary experience and a fighting spirit that would serve them well

192
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,190
in the revolution to come.

193
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,640
So the leaders of the various Marxist discussion groups in St.

194
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,680
Petersburg got together and founded this thing called the Union for the Struggle of the

195
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,660
Emancipation of the Working Class.

196
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:08,690
The union adopted Markoff's recommended strategy Talk less, listen more, publish

197
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,780
leaflets, not books, focus on lived reality, not abstract theory.

198
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,580
Your audience is the workers, not other coffee house radicals.

199
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,240
Now, the actual membership of this coordinating union of struggle was never very big,

200
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,110
maybe 20 members and all Lenin and marched off, both sat on the central committee where

201
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,060
they implemented Mahtob strategy.

202
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,620
Their first task was to go out among the workers and find out what their grievances

203
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,940
actually were. So they printed and distributed questionnaires for people to fill out that

204
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,260
they hoped would allow them to cobble together a list of complaints that might motivate

205
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,700
the workers to go on strike.

206
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,820
And this did generate some useful information.

207
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,200
And the members of the union also attempted to supplement this with direct personal

208
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,480
interviews. But as we've discussed, many of the members of the Union of Struggle were

209
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,120
white collar, middle and upper class intellectuals.

210
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,860
They'd come around asking these potentially seditious questions of the workers and be met

211
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,310
with understandably tight lipped suspicion from those workers.

212
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,900
But groups Guy was assigned to one of the poorest working class districts.

213
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,490
And thanks to her years of experience and connections as a night school teacher, she was

214
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,050
able to come back with reliably detailed information about pay conditions and hours.

215
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,400
And one of the most interesting things to come out of this exercise in gathering

216
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,280
information was that the managers had a habit of imposing fines on workers for any number

217
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,460
of infractions. So they're already pitifully low.

218
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,500
Hourly wages were in reality, even lower than that because their pay was routinely

219
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,360
docked. Lennon, with his training as a lawyer, would soon be writing up a 44 page booklet

220
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,780
explaining to the workers their rights with regards to these fines.

221
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,560
But that was the last thing he was able to do as a free man, because as he sat down to

222
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,250
get started on the first issue of a new newspaper, they hoped to get going.

223
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,170
Lennon was arrested.

224
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,910
For as much as our young revolutionaries enjoyed playing cloak and dagger, dodging

225
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,140
surveillance and meeting secretly and writing to each other in secret codes with

226
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,480
invisible ink in all the stuff you find in a standard issue spy novel, the Irana was

227
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,310
watching them pretty much the whole time.

228
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,170
Lenin was well-known.

229
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,330
He had been tracked in and out of Europe.

230
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,920
The authorities knew about his false bottom trunk that he used to bring home illegal

231
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,530
literature. But as long as Lenin and his comrades posed no immediate threat, it was

232
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,630
better to just wait.

233
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,690
Monitor them, gather more information, more names and more plans.

234
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,570
And most especially, wait until they did something.

235
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,550
You could really nail them to the wall for.

236
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,250
Now, the reason the authorities knew so much about them is because they had spies,

237
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,560
informants and agents provocateur liberally sprinkled around keeping tabs on everyone.

238
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,740
Among the founders of the Union of Struggle was a certain dentist who was just such a

239
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,210
spy. Now, the problem of police spies was one of the biggest hurdles that Lenin and his

240
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,190
comrades struggled to overcome.

241
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,420
It's one of the biggest problems any revolutionary group struggles to overcome.

242
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,030
You can't trust nobody because if you trust nobody, then you're just a paranoid crank

243
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,940
hiding out in a studio apartment, afraid to talk to anybody.

244
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,790
You're not a revolutionary of the people, but you also can't trust everybody because for

245
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,490
sure, some of your comrades are police spies.

246
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,990
Of course they are. Now, in his novel, The Moon is a harsh mistress, which is a manual

247
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,120
for revolution dressed up as a space adventure.

248
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,970
Heinlein recommend making friends with a sentient and basically omniscient supercomputer

249
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,740
who will be able to identify such police spies, group them together in their own cordoned

250
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,890
off revolutionary cells where you can feed them disinformation.

251
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,530
But in the absence of a sentient and basically omniscient supercomputer, spies are going

252
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,590
to get in. You just have to trust your instincts.

253
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,810
Trust evidence that they are spies.

254
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,710
If and when it does come in and then go with your gut.

255
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,180
In these early days, especially, Lenin tended to air on the side of being too trusting.

256
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,640
So because they trusted this dentist, everyone wound up arrested before they got a chance

257
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,040
to do much of anything in 1895.

258
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,800
Now, the authorities finally decided to go from surveillance to arrest in November 1895

259
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,240
because some factory workers did start a brief strike and the authorities became

260
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,930
concerned that maybe this new Union of Struggle group was having an impact.

261
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,600
So the dentist's spy tipped off his handlers that the six principal editors of the new

262
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
underground newspaper would all be in the same place at the same time.

263
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,490
On December the 8th, the police raided the rooms and Lenin and five of his comrades were

264
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,800
carried away about a month later.

265
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,560
A second sweep picked up Mahtob and a bunch of others.

266
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,060
Now, not all the members of the union struggle were in custody groups.

267
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,680
Guy kept her name clear, as did some of the younger members, and they tried to carry on

268
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,910
with their agitation work.

269
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,550
And though it was difficult, it was not impossible to stay in contact with their

270
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,630
imprisoned comrades.

271
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,320
As we saw last week, the people running the prisons and detention centers were not

272
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,720
exactly committed to their jobs and for the entirety of 1896, while Lenin and Mahtob and

273
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,250
friends were held in the preliminary detention facility, which is where you were held

274
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,470
without trial until your sentence was handed down.

275
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,850
They freely access their comrades on the outside without too much difficulty.

276
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,720
They used coded language, an invisible ink and hidden notes smuggled into the binding of

277
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,530
books because the inspectors at the detention facility never tried too hard to stop it.

278
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,870
And in between this regular correspondence, Lenin, for example, was able to return to

279
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,540
more abstract theoretical ideas beginning work on his first contribution to Russian

280
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:01,980
Marxism, the development of capital in Russia, a Lenin's principal facilitator.

281
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,060
And all this was crib's Gaia, who was still on the outside and who had taken a job as a

282
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,070
copyist in the Railroad Administration.

283
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,770
She happened to have a co-worker who was a non movement family friend of the lianas, who

284
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,800
could somewhat innocuously visit Lenin in prison.

285
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,770
So people would send letters to Coop's guy at her office.

286
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,360
She would write or in code things into books and letters, hand them off to this family

287
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,270
friend who would then take it all into Lenin.

288
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,710
And it was in this way that everybody inside prison was able to cheer on the strikes of

289
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:37,770
1896. These great strikes were, of course, blamed on the socialist agitators, and the

290
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,650
socialist agitators were happy to take credit for it.

291
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,620
But in fact, the strikes were quite spontaneous and undirected by anyone inside the union

292
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,590
of struggle. The 1896 St.

293
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,270
Petersburg textile workers strikes were something of a watershed in retrospect, and their

294
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,400
importance only grew in time, as it seemed to be proving what Carl Koutsoukis had said in

295
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,260
which the Vilna program was working towards the merger of the blue collar worker and the

296
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,750
white collar socialist into a single movement.

297
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,990
The strikes lasted for three weeks in May and June 1896 and were the largest industrial

298
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,180
worker actions in Russian history to date.

299
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,860
The strike specifically hit the textile industries in Saint Petersburg, where you found

300
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,430
the lowest paid, least educated and most maltreated workers.

301
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,870
These people were doing 12 to 14 hour days and miserably hot conditions.

302
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:35,870
Doing monotonous activity began as a small walkout of just a few workers in one single

303
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:41,120
textile plant, but quickly spread to 20 more factories and in the end included at a

304
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,370
minimum 18000 workers and at a maximum thirty thousand depending on what source you're

305
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,660
looking at. Half of these workers were men and half of these workers were women.

306
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,150
And it was a big moment in Russian labor history.

307
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,800
And the liberal professor turned liberal politician Pavel Millia cough, who we talked

308
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,350
about back in episode ten point 20, said that the 1896 strikes were when the Russian

309
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,500
masses first stepped on to the revolutionary stage.

310
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:13,910
The first action started on May the 23rd, 1896, when about one hundred very low grade

311
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:19,100
assistance walked off the job and demanded pay for the recent plant closure that had

312
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,780
coincided with the coronation of Tsar Nicholas, the second, who I should mention we will

313
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,430
be catching back up with next week.

314
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:31,520
Now, in addition to this recent affront, they were also demanding back pay related to

315
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,740
this additional twenty minutes of unpaid labor that employers had started adding to the

316
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,930
end of the day back in 1887.

317
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,860
This is just 20 minutes that were tacked onto the end of the day that you weren't paid

318
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,720
for. It was as literal an expression of the exploitation of surplus labor as you could

319
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,760
get. The next day, these hundred assistants were joined by about 100 spinners at the

320
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,680
plant who further demanded a shorter workday, and this first plant would remain shut down

321
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,690
until June the 5th.

322
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,950
In the meantime, word of this strike spread to other workers as they talked to each other

323
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,930
at Canteen's or in parks or shared boardinghouses.

324
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,810
And it became very apparent very quickly that these workers understood the importance of

325
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,780
getting as many factories as possible to catch the contagion of strike just as a single

326
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,210
workers isolated without his or her co-workers.

327
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,560
A single factory is isolated without other factories also joining in.

328
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,500
So over the last week of May 1896, the strike spread to the six hundred workers in this

329
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,300
factory over here than the 700 in that factory over there, eventually reaching something

330
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,770
like 20 factories and all.

331
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,520
And as I said, somewhere between 13 and 30000 workers.

332
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,250
Now, these strikes were not started by the union of struggle, but when they got going,

333
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,950
the remaining free members of the union did what they could.

334
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,570
And principally that meant helping spread the word and make sure other people knew what

335
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,490
was happening. This turned out to be extremely helpful because previously the authorities

336
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,530
had just been able clamp down on all information about an isolated factory strike to stop

337
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,390
the contagion of strike from spreading.

338
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,270
But they were unable to do this in 1896.

339
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,340
So for three weeks, St Petersburg had to deal with tens of thousands of workers refusing

340
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,700
to work and the textile industry basically shutting down.

341
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,990
Now, in the end, no great victory was really won here.

342
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,100
Some small concessions were extracted and the factories restarted.

343
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:31,970
Now, another follow on strike in early 1897 did eventually lead to a maximum hour law

344
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,610
being passed by the government later in 1897.

345
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,220
But the importance of the 1896 strikes weren't just about what specific demands they

346
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,560
extracted. They were peaceful and disciplined and seemed to be both spontaneous and

347
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,860
widespread, which indicated prior organization and planning.

348
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,350
And given that on agitation had just come out, it seemed like the merger between the

349
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,810
workers and the socialist was in fact taking place.

350
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,680
And even if we know in retrospect that that merger was not fully consummated in 1896, it

351
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,700
certainly showed that things were heading in that direction, which terrified

352
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,530
conservatives, exhilarated radicals, and made cautious liberals wring their hands and beg

353
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:17,830
for reform. And working class demonstrations, strikes and direct actions would only pick

354
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,840
up steam as Russia's embrace of industrialization continued and everyone pointed

355
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,360
themselves toward these shockingly massive confrontations of 4:41.

356
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,860
But 4:41 is still a little ways off, though I promise we are moving towards it quicker

357
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,610
than you might realize, certainly quicker than anyone in Russia realized.

358
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,810
But before the revolution could come, the members of the Union of Struggle were going to

359
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:44,290
have to become exiles and emigres groups.

360
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:49,700
Guy was finally identified as a revolutionary and arrested in August of 1896, and she

361
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,360
drew got placed in the preliminary detention facility.

362
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,780
Then they all sat in custody until the end of January 1897, when their sentences were

363
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:04,030
handed down and they all agreed these sentences were surprisingly light.

364
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,310
Just three years exile in Siberia.

365
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,800
They even got three days freedom in St.

366
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,650
Petersburg to arrange their affairs and prepare for their trip.

367
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,320
And it was over these three days that Lenin and Ma Tof apparently cemented their lasting

368
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,450
friendship. In the few months they had worked together at the end of 1895, they hardly

369
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,480
knew each other. They were still strangers and they were kept separate.

370
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,580
In the preliminary detention facility.

371
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,130
But here in these last 72 hours, they bonded.

372
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,180
Even if they had been apart, they had gone through something together.

373
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,320
Their spirit was unbroken and both of them were as committed to the cause as ever.

374
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,610
So they agreed to ride out their three years in exile without making any attempt to

375
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,390
escape. And then they would meet backup and plot their next move.

376
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,050
Among the last minute arrangements Lennon made before he had to depart east was to write

377
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,550
a small message in invisible ink to croup Skiba, who being arrested later than the

378
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,810
others, was still in prison.

379
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,900
The invisible note was a marriage proposal.

380
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,260
Vladimir and Nadia had now known each other and work together for nearly three years.

381
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,270
And they liked each other and respected each other.

382
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,580
Most importantly, if she agreed to marry him, then their union would be recognized by the

383
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,440
state and she would be allowed to come join Lenin in Siberia, where they could continue

384
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,990
their work. And if nothing else, keep each other company.

385
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,600
She agreed. Now, the marriage of Lenin and Group Sky would never be the stuff of romance

386
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,400
novels, and down the road it will become emotionally complicated, but they will remain

387
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,400
loyally married until death did them part.

388
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,650
So next week, we will ship these revolutionaries off to Siberia, but keep the story in

389
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:48,140
St. Petersburg to pick back up with newlyweds whose marriage, for better or for worse,

390
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,690
was more like something out of a romance novel.

391
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,570
They really, truly loved each other as man and wife.

392
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,700
And I am talking here about Nicholas and ALEXANDRA, who are opening their reign as

393
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,160
emperor and empress of Russia by telling all those whose hopes for progress, reform and

394
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,050
change, hopes which had been raised by the elevation of the young czar, and that those

395
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,940
hopes were hopeless.

396
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,440
No, no, no, you silly heads, there will be no progress, reform and change.

397
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,010
There will be only orthodoxy, autocracy and nationality.

398
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,040
And isn't that simply marvelous?
