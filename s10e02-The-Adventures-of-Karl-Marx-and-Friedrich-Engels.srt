12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,740
My personal recommendation this time is the latest massive classic which I've never read

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,480
but decided to finally listen to.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,850
And it's the Once and Future King by T.H.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,290
White. I've never read it, but it's always been on my list and I came by it because I got

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,300
the version read by Neville Jason.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,050
That again is Neville Jason.

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,240
He's the one who read the version of Warren piece that I also listen to and also highly

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,760
recommend. So if you're looking for 33 hours of medieval Arthurian fantasy, it's pretty

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,740
great. You can start listening with a 30 day audible trial and your first audio book,

Hello and welcome to revolutions.

27
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,110
Episode ten point two, The Adventures of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,370
We launched this series last week by launching the International Working Men's

29
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,530
Association in 1864.

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,260
Mostly I did this because the international tried to bring all left wing political groups

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,880
together under a single tent.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,410
And since I'm trying to avoid making the Russian Revolution the narrow story of the

33
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,700
Bolsheviks, it seemed like a good way to establish that the Bolsheviks are going to

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,440
emerge as one faction that represented one variant of Russian Marxism.

35
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,800
But there were a lot of other factions and variants out there.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,110
Unionist, anarchist, socialists, communists, reformers, revolutionaries.

37
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,510
But all that said, the Bolsheviks are ultimately the victorious faction from the

38
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,340
victorious variant of Marxism.

39
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,220
So it's going to be important to understand where they came from.

40
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,220
So as the title of this episode suggests, today will be an intertwined biographical

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,630
sketch of the lives of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels that will take us through to the

42
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,250
foundation of the international.

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,800
And then next week, we will go through the critical concepts to understand the philosophy

44
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,190
and revolutionary program that became known as Marxism.

45
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,950
Then we'll go on to do the same for Bakunin and the anarchists so that we understand what

46
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,630
core revolutionary principles were out there that opposed what some people saw as the

47
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,080
authoritarian tendencies implicit in that Marxism.

48
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,830
Karl Marx was born in 1818 in the city of Tahrir.

49
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,590
A middle sized city in the Rhineland.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,900
Little Karl was born just three years after the final fall of Napoleon.

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,580
Non-career had been under French administration going back to the 1790s.

52
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,590
But at the very recent Congress of Vienna, it was handed to the Prussian monarchy, whose

53
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,740
backward looking feudal conservatism clashed with the more progressive and forward

54
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,580
looking Rhine. Both of Karl's parents had ethnic Jewish lineage.

55
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,460
But to maintain his budding legal practice, Marx's father converted to Protestantism when

56
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,500
the Prussians took over and instituted more carefully draconian restrictions on what Jews

57
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,730
could and could not do.

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,580
Not that this conversion was anything but nominal.

59
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,150
Marx's father was into Contine Voltaire and the Enlightenment.

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,560
And though his children were baptized Luther and they were hardly a religious bunch.

61
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,760
Karl then got a good enough secondary education where he was sent to the University of

62
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,500
Bonn in 1835 to study law.

63
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,100
But Karl's first year at university was mostly filled with drinking beer and reckless

64
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,630
brawling. And so his dad shipped him off to the University of Berlin, which was located

65
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,080
in the capital of the kingdom before Carl departed.

66
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,150
He proposed marriage to Jenny Vun Vest fallen the daughter of a minor nobles civil

67
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,040
servant. And though the couple were only together in person once over the next five

68
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,070
years, and that one time they got together almost wrecked their relationship.

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,390
Their engagement held. And when they finally got married, they remained together through

70
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,590
the occasionally thick and very often thin rest of their lives.

71
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,800
Arriving in Berlin in 1836, Carl did something even worse than drinking and brawling.

72
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,470
He became enamored with philosophy in Germany in the mid 1830s.

73
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,110
Getting into philosophy meant getting into the just recently deceased Hagel, whose

74
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,600
philosophy cast an all encompassing shadow over German intellectual life, especially here

75
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,490
in the first half of the 19th century.

76
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,290
We'll talk a little bit more next week about what concepts Marx pulled out of Hegel.

77
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,810
But for now, the crowd Marx fell in with was the more radical and iconoclastic group

78
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,510
called The Young Aliens.

79
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,230
The young Hegg aliens were working from themes that came from the early days of the

80
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,030
French Revolution, and they took Hegel seriously when he said that the purpose and course

81
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,740
of history was all about the abolition of anything that restricts freedom and the use of

82
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,110
reason. The young Galen's were obviously critical of the repressive Prussian government,

83
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,200
but unable to express their opposition openly.

84
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,660
They turned to theology and philosophy.

85
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,910
They published challenges to the reliability, historicity and believability of

86
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,470
Christianity and the Bible.

87
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,150
They believed that by doing this, they could undermine one of the core pillars of the

88
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,490
Prussian monarchies alleged legitimacy.

89
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,070
Marx fell in with the young aliens at the worst possible moment because while their

90
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,990
controversial philosophy was tolerated by King Friedrich Wilhelm, the third of Prussia

91
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,410
when he died in 1840, and his son Friedrich Vill Helm, the fourth ascended to power, that

92
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,520
tolerance evaporated.

93
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,310
Now you know Friedrich Wilhelm, the fourth from our episodes on 1848 because he will be

94
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,280
the King of Prussia during the revolutions of 1848.

95
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,820
He's the one who had to crawl on his belly away from Berlin.

96
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,240
Conservative, romantic and evangelical.

97
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,260
This Friedrich Wilhelm had no tolerance for seditious blasphemy.

98
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,180
And so the young hag aliens were marked and blacklisted in spite of this.

99
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,190
Marx pressed on with a doctoral thesis that used a Galey and methods to analyze ancient

100
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,810
metaphysics. Even though his conclusions were now outside the boundaries of acceptable

101
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,900
thinking, knowing he couldn't submit his thesis to the University of Berlin, Marx instead

102
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,060
sent it to the more permissive University of Jayna, which made him a doctor of

103
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,990
philosophy. In 1841.

104
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,560
But as I just said, this was a bad time to be a young Hegelian, and Marx's dream of a

105
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
university position was squelched.

106
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,240
To make matters worse, Marx's father had died in 1838, beginning endless rounds of

107
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,070
bickering with his money over money from the inheritance to make a living.

108
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,500
Marx, like many of his ideological comrade, turned from academia to journalism.

109
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,340
So this newly minted doctor of philosophy moved to Cologne, where he submitted articles

110
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,810
to a progressive paper called the Rhineland News.

111
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,340
Showing off a rhetorical style that was a setback witty, intelligent, sarcastic and

112
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,600
occasionally savage.

113
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,540
This was also the period that by his own account, he started being handed socialist and

114
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,020
communist ideas, moving him away from abstract philosophy towards the realities of social

115
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,130
and economic life.

116
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,430
When the editorial brain trust of the Rhineland news fell apart, Marx became its de facto

117
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,830
editor in chief in the middle of 1842.

118
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,010
The paper was successful and that looked like that Karl Marx was going to be a newspaper

119
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:40,070
editor in Cologne. But the paranoid hand of conservative censorship dug up Marx's new

120
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,320
roots before they even had a chance to settle.

121
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,310
The Rhineland news was suppressed and banned in 1843.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,830
Whatever plans Marx may have had for a normal life with a steady income were turned

123
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,780
upside down by his politics.

124
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,840
During his stint with the Rhineland News, Markes came into contact with a young

125
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,410
semi-anonymous contributor named Friedrich Engels.

126
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,980
Engels was two and a half years younger than Marx.

127
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:15,170
Born in 1820 in Barmen City, about 35 miles east of Cologne, the Engels family were first

128
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,990
devout evangelical Protestants and second industrial pioneers in the Rhineland.

129
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,180
They owned textile factories in the region and had further expanded up to Manchester,

130
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,100
England, which was rapidly transforming into a hive of industrial factories.

131
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,220
The scion of this rich, capitalist and very religious family rebelled on nearly every

132
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,820
front. In 1842, Engels did a requisite year in the Prussian army and stationed in Berlin.

133
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,560
He attended lectures and came into social and intellectual contact with both the young

134
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,410
Hegg aliens and various Proteau socialists.

135
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,810
Engels took to thinking and writing, and he submitted pieces to the Rhineland News

136
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,990
anonymously, as I said, since he was the son of filthy rich capitalists scandalized by

137
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,270
their son's new friends and his new ideas.

138
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,270
His parents sent him to Manchester to apprentice in a family owned factory there and in

139
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,950
the annals of parents trying to halt the radicalization of their children, only to see it

140
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:22,130
backfire. Sending Friedrich Engels to Manchester may be the single greatest backfire in

141
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:29,100
world history. Now, despite having lost his job, Karl Marx and Jenny von Vest fallen

142
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:35,910
married and moved to Paris in October of 1843 under the semi liberal auspices of the July

143
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:42,000
monarchy, Paris was a haven for emigre radicals from across Europe Russians and Poles,

144
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,520
Italians, Germans, Spaniards, creating a swirling mildew of nationalists and Democrats,

145
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,560
socialists, anarchists, tepid reformers and single minded revolutionaries.

146
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,690
The Marxists settled down, and their first daughter, little Jenny, was born in early

147
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,540
1844. Marx worked as a contributor and editor for a couple of different German language

148
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,850
publications, meant for audiences in the emigre community, but also for audiences back in

149
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,350
Germany. None of this work, though, was steady or particularly profitable.

150
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,910
Engle's, meanwhile, went off to Manchester, where he embarked on a program of

151
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,350
self-radicalization. He was absolutely appalled by what he found there.

152
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,300
Shortly after arriving, Engle's met an Irish worker named Mary Burns.

153
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,910
They fell in love and began a 20 year non marriage marriage where they never tied the

154
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,160
knot because they both rejected the oppressive bourgeois institution that was marriage.

155
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,430
Mary Byrnes was Engels is early guide to Manchester and he was deeply affected by what he

156
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:51,700
saw. And basically, he saw every single stereotypical thing you might cram into a period

157
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,880
piece drama about England during the industrial revolution.

158
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,550
Crowded slums, ill fed, filthy workers, men and women walking around with missing limbs,

159
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,740
child labour, environmental degradation, grinding metal, choking, black smoke.

160
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,260
The works Engels started writing articles and submitting them to various outlets.

161
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,530
Among them, those Marks was working on in Paris.

162
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,650
Pretty soon, Engels decided to collect and revise his notes and articles and ideas and

163
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,880
turn them into a book that he called The Conditions of the Working Classes in England,

164
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,320
which became his first contribution to mid 19th century socialism.

165
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,800
Now, in semi-regular correspondence with Marx, Engels swung through Paris on his way back

166
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,240
to Germany so they could meet.

167
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,960
And on August 28, 1844, they got together at a cafe near the Palais Royale.

168
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,580
It was not technically the first time they had met, but it was the first time that they

169
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,590
realized what kindred spirits they were.

170
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:57,740
The two young men, both still in their mid-twenties, got along famously and Engels wound

171
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,080
up staying at Marks's home for the next 10 days.

172
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,110
The beginning of a lifelong collaboration and friendship.

173
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,800
Marked by this point had begun thinking deeper and more seriously about the link between

174
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,420
economics, society and politics, and not just in the abstract.

175
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,420
Marx was a man who dreamed of revolution, and he had hit upon this idea that the new

176
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,390
industrial, quote unquote, working class might just be miserable enough to be the engine

177
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,560
of the next revolution.

178
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,570
And when angles came along with these horribly evocative descriptions of working class

179
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,250
misery, they agreed with each other that they were really onto something that they had

180
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,770
discovered. The revolutionary proletariat, both Marx and Angles, then got involved, at

181
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,450
least peripherally, with a radical group of emigre German artisans who had formed

182
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,070
themselves into something they called the League of the just to promote socialist and

183
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:56,380
anarchist philosophy and prepare for the very revolution Marx and Engels now believed was

184
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:02,840
coming. The Marks's probably would have stayed in Paris indefinitely, or at least until

185
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,460
the revolution came. But Prussian diplomats complain to the French government about

186
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,130
radical German propaganda being produced in Paris and in 1845 demanded that some of the

187
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,740
more offensive elements be expelled from France.

188
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,370
Specifically citing this guy, Karl Marx, to his horror and dismay, Marx discovered he had

189
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,320
one week to leave the country and the order was signed personally by France SWAT.

190
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,960
Gizo earning lifelong enmity from Marx, who then had to pack up his wife Jenny, who was

191
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,860
pregnant again, and little Jenny, and scoot over to Brussels to start over again to keep

192
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,770
himself free of the long arm of Prussian conservatism.

193
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,390
About six months after arriving in Brussels, Marx renounced his citizenship.

194
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,510
Their arrival in Brussels happened to coincide with the beginning of the hungry forties.

195
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,740
The potato blight and harvest failures were going to send recessive shockwaves

196
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,080
reverberating through every sector of the European economy.

197
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,830
So the going was hard for the Marx family and his son Edgar was born in February 1847 at

198
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,160
a very difficult time, both for his family and for families across Europe.

199
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,060
In Brussels, Marx and Engels also reconnected on a more permanent basis, and they

200
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,550
actively collaborated on various book ideas, some of which, like the Holy Family, were

201
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:31,370
published at the time, while others, like the German ideology, sat around in piles of

202
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,080
paper until Soviet researchers put them out in the 1920s and 1930s.

203
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,660
Most of these ideas, though, revolved around their various beefs with other German

204
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,130
radicals and philosophers.

205
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:49,340
Old friends and mentors became derided rivals as Marx and Angles moved decisively towards

206
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,420
the idea that material economics was the basis of everything else.

207
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:00,110
And if you disagreed, prepared to be skewered with a sarcastic and acidic pen they broke

208
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,250
with the young had Galen's.

209
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,320
They attacked other socialist theorists as Philistines and heretics and reactionary pawns

210
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,240
who all either had things upside down, or if they had things right side up, they

211
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,550
advocated different means to the same ends.

212
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,670
Now, Marx and Engels were not unique in this regard.

213
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,860
And in return they were attacked, derided and mocked just as hard and with just as much

214
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,280
venom. But outside of these beefs, they continued to keep an eye out for the revolution.

215
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,660
And in one of Marx's works from this period that only saw the light of day well after he

216
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,790
was dead, he wrote that, quote, Philosophers have hit there, too.

217
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,230
Only interpreted the world in various ways.

218
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,510
The point is to change it.

219
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,080
But when it came to changing the world, Marx was never a fan of Blanky style

220
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,090
revolutionary Vanguard ism and he wanted the working class move Mr.

221
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:57,260
B. Out in the open, not secret that their great power was in their great numbers.

222
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,620
Let the ruling classes tremble, exerting more intellectual force inside the League of the

223
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,070
Just. Marx succeeded in getting them to make a strategic shift in June of 1847.

224
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,710
The League of the just rebranded itself as the Communist League and then came out into

225
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,370
the open to attract members and announced their program.

226
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,520
They commissioned Marx and Angles to draft a manifesto.

227
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,050
Mark's got to work using as his foundation a pamphlet Engels had written called

228
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,690
Principles of Communism, which Marx then redrafted and reworked into what has gone down

229
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,780
in history as the Communist Manifesto.

230
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,430
Now, as I said in Episode 8.1,

231
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,200
the Communist Manifesto was more prophetic than it was a work rooted in the actual

232
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,390
economic and material conditions of Europe.

233
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:54,360
At that moment. Prophetic in part because angles just so happened to have been sent to

234
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,520
Manchester, which was then on the leading edge of full blown industrial capitalism, which

235
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,140
would not really sweep the globe until the later 19th century and early 20th century.

236
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,260
But it did show that most of the basics of later fully developed Marxism were already in

237
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,440
place by 1848 historical materialism, class conflict, the exploitation of labor by the

238
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,450
bourgeoisie, and the historical role of the proletariat as the next revolutionary class

239
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,740
whose aim would be the abolition of bourgeois property relations.

240
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,950
The Communist Manifesto also advocated such civilization shattering policies as a

241
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,350
progressive income tax, a national bank, free, universal, secular education and the

242
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,900
suburbs. This revolutionary statement of Principles was published in London in February

243
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,770
1848 by complete coincidence.

244
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,300
The February revolution hit Paris at almost that same moment.

245
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,150
For all their anticipation and planning and organizing, this revolution took Marx and

246
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,970
Angles and frankly, everybody else by surprise.

247
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,640
As revolutions nearly always do.

248
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,390
The authorities in Brussels were terrified by the revolution in France.

249
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:13,030
And on March the 3rd, 1848, they expelled everyone who might potentially destabilise

250
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,200
Belgium. Marx and Angles and other Communist League guys were on the list.

251
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,210
But that was OK because their lives as emigres and exiles was over.

252
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,990
It was time to go home and embark on the revolution.

253
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,680
Now, at this point, everything is moving in a straight line.

254
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,020
Marx and Engels had been young, stubbornly nonconformist students who had been

255
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,520
radicalized, politically, dreamed about and work towards a revolution against the

256
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,840
conservative powers of Europe.

257
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,420
And now that revolution was at hand.

258
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,920
With the revolution afoot, Marx and his family went back to Cologne.

259
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,760
Other members of the Communist League went to other German cities to start a Pan German

260
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:59,640
revolutionary network to make sure this went right and by went right.

261
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,890
Marx specifically meant carrying out his theory of a double revolution in Prussia.

262
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,730
First, they must recreate the course of the French Revolution.

263
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,770
Have all classes combined behind the liberal bourgeoisie to topple the Prussian monarchy.

264
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,440
Once that was accomplished, the working class proletariat could break off an immediately

265
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,780
stage a second revolution against the oh so recently triumphant liberal bourgeoisie.

266
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,950
Thus they would advance rapidly towards the dream of communism.

267
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,590
Marks's part in all this was to wield the pen, and he started a new paper dubbed the New

268
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,080
Rhineland News to publish his ideas.

269
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:44,170
The paper was successful locally, but events moved very quickly and Marks's activities in

270
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,550
1848 would ultimately be limited just to the city of Cologne.

271
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,860
The Communist League struggled to make inroads with the actual workers they were supposed

272
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,960
to be representing. They also had trouble forming alliances with other socialist leaders

273
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,000
who Marx and Angles had just spent the last few years so thoroughly mocking and deriding

274
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:09,190
to say nothing of the articles in the new Rhineland news that denounced rival working

275
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,200
class organizations as reactionary.

276
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,760
Not because they were insufficiently radical, but because they were too radical.

277
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,920
These leaders wanted to skip the bourgeois revolution that Marx thought was so essential.

278
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,800
So they didn't want to make alliances with the Democrats.

279
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,620
They wanted to move straight on to the revolution of the worker.

280
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,360
And these leaders, in turn, thought Marx was a cowardly stooge of the bourgeoisie for

281
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,840
advancing the necessity of this bourgeois revolution in the first place.

282
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,330
Not that it mattered. By the fall and winter of 1848, everything was falling apart.

283
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,070
The King of Prussia disbanded the Prussian diet, and the Frankfurt Parliament did not

284
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,450
seem long for this world.

285
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,810
Only with the walls closing in in April 1849 did Marx belatedly conclude that the

286
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,610
Democrats were too cautious and uncommitted, and that a strong, unified push had to come

287
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,650
from the workers and the workers alone.

288
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:07,830
But in May of 1849, the hammer of reaction fell hard in Cologne, flexing his muscle after

289
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,740
being forced to sew, ignominiously crawl on his belly.

290
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,280
King Friedrich Wilhelm, the fourth, put the Prussian army on the move.

291
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,320
The Frankfurt parliament broke and fled, disappearing into the footnotes of history.

292
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,930
Marx, who had never regained his renounced citizenship, was expelled from Cologne as an

293
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:30,090
alien. On May the 19th, which coincided with the last issue of the now banned and

294
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:36,060
suppressed new Rhineland news in these chaotic final days, Engels joined a volunteer

295
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:42,240
rifle company led by Future Union Army Major General Auguste Volk to fight the last stand

296
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,660
of the revolution. Marx was no soldier and he made for Paris, and he would occasionally

297
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,490
be dogged for the rest of his life by accusations of cowardice by those who did stay in

298
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,120
Germany and fight. But the cause was well and truly hopeless.

299
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,310
By this point, and the company Engels had joined was quickly pushed across the border

300
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:10,620
into Switzerland. In Paris, Marx hoped to find radical Democrats and socialists combining

301
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,630
into a coalition that would seize control of the Second Republic and turn France into the

302
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,990
revolution's war machine.

303
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,500
Just as the first republic had once done.

304
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,300
But by now, French President Bonaparte and the party of order had come to power.

305
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,840
After probably witnessing the suppression of those Paris radicals in June of 1849, Marx

306
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,310
was told he could stay in France if he removed himself to the coast of Brittany and made

307
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:40,620
no trouble. Instead, he quit Paris and went to London, calling for Jenny and their three

308
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,800
kids to join him. He arrived in England in August of 1849.

309
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,610
Karl Marx was 32 years old.

310
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,480
The revolution was hopefully only set back, but not yet dead.

311
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,440
Marx prepared for a life of temporary exile in London.

312
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,170
He would live there for the rest of his life.

313
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,530
That life in London was tough on the Marks's as the city filled with other exiles fleeing

314
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,960
the reactionary hammer, working class artisans and more professional types like doctors

315
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,190
and lawyers could find work.

316
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,650
But Karl Marx was a radical journalist who didn't speak English and who carried few other

317
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,810
credentials or letters of recommendation.

318
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,100
The Marks's spent the next few years hovering around destitution.

319
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,070
They were broke and constantly harassed by creditors.

320
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,470
During these miserable years, the German emigre community in London was itself a

321
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,930
miserable mix of pessimistic disillusionment or recklessly grandiose declarations that

322
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,730
they must restart the revolution now.

323
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,610
It was full of rivalries, infighting, denunciations, blame, tossing police spies and

324
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,840
agents provocateur.

325
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,420
Marx's mood completely soured, and he systematically got into fights with everyone,

326
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,960
contributing to his isolation from practically everyone.

327
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,600
Jenny gave birth to another son in September of 1849, but the baby died just a month

328
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,520
later. Just about the only friend Mark's had left in the world was Angles, who arrived in

329
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,770
England in November 1849, himself destitute and without prospects.

330
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,840
Engels decided to tactically renounce his revolutionary past so that his parents would

331
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,130
let him work in the family business again, so that he could make a living not just for

332
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,250
himself, but he also sent cash when he could to.

333
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,680
He wasn't very happy about having to take this job, but it was all for a good cause.

334
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,260
Marx and Engels is last hope for getting the revolution going again in Germany ended in

335
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,890
1851 when their last remaining allies in Cologne.

336
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,240
People who they were actually allied with were arrested in a police sweep.

337
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,780
Then at the end of the year came the last cruel blow, the last spark of hope that Paris

338
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,580
might yet save the revolution in Europe was smothered by the coup of print President

339
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,280
Bonaparte in December 1851.

340
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,860
The revolution was over.

341
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,480
Friendless, broke.

342
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,540
Angry and terminally depressed.

343
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,650
Marx responded by writing the 18th broodmare of Louis Bonaparte.

344
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,770
It's easily Marx's greatest literary work.

345
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,150
And I really do highly recommend it, especially since if you've listened to the episodes

346
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:22,280
on 1848 and the Paris Commune and then these episodes right now, you'll have some idea

347
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,160
who and what he is talking about, making use of a line from angles that history repeats

348
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,710
itself first as tragedy, then as farce.

349
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,520
Marx deconstructed the course of the failed revolution in France.

350
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,340
But when you read the 18th primary, keep in mind that when Marx is criticizing all the

351
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,420
dummies who thought that they were going to play act a revival of the French Revolution,

352
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,330
he's kind of talking about himself and his scathing criticism of those who thought cross

353
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,800
class alliances were possible or would end in anything but the betrayal of the working

354
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:01,430
class. He's also talking about himself repudiating and walking away from those positions.

355
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,620
It all makes for great reading.

356
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,620
It's a great review of 1848 and its aftermath.

357
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,030
It's really well written.

358
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:13,460
It's fun and rightly one of the great masterpieces of 19th century political commentary.

359
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:20,030
It's also an epistle from a failed revolutionary wallowing in veiled self-criticism as he

360
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:25,060
descends into broke and friendless obscurity, having alienated himself from everyone.

361
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,370
Renouncing revolutionary activism, we now get to the familiar version of an older and

362
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:37,800
more worn down Karl Marx going daily to the British Museum Library to pore over mountains

363
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,140
of government records and reports, newspapers, history books and philosophy as he made

364
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,290
mountains of notes.

365
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:49,080
For any eternally forthcoming magnum opus on political economy.

366
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:55,590
To make a living, he got hooked into a job as European correspondent for Horace Greeley's

367
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,250
Progressive, an abolitionist paper, The New York Daily Tribune.

368
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:05,280
Writing for The New York Daily Tribune gave Marks the steady income he needed, and Engels

369
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,950
pitched in again to ghostwrite some of these articles.

370
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,740
For example, accounts of the Crimean War, which gave Engels an outlet for his pen and got

371
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,590
his friend a few more paychecks.

372
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:21,570
But though Marx's life was stabilizing, he was still depressing and rocked by tragedy.

373
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,840
Their eight year old son, Edgar, unexpectedly succumbed to a fatal ailment in 1855, and

374
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,510
then another baby died in 1857 without even being named Marx.

375
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,130
His health was in a state of constant decline.

376
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,070
He drank too much and smoked too many cheap cigars.

377
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,920
And the possibility that none of this really mattered.

378
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,190
None of this was ever going to matter seemed very real indeed.

379
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,790
But he kept scribbling his notes in the British Library.

380
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,360
Dedicated full time to research and writing.

381
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:57,630
Marx finally produced a contribution to the critique of political economy in 1859, which

382
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,940
developed in further detail his theories about.

383
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,730
Capitalism money politics and history.

384
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,920
It was meant to advance and correct the traditions of classical economics that had begun

385
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,840
with Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

386
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,630
It was exciting and bold stuff and sold quite well among interested German readers and it

387
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,220
gave marks both the moral and financial boost he needed to finally fulfill his life's

388
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:27,660
work which would eventually become known simply as Das Kapital or in English capital in

389
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,800
the early 1860.

390
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,420
Things were looking up.

391
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:35,910
Engels his father finally died and so his communist son inherited the family's capitalist

392
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:41,190
fortune. Engels put Marx on an annual alliance that put his friend who Engels was

393
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,900
convinced was one of history's great geniuses into a state of permanent financial

394
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,620
security in 1864 Marx was forty six years old.

395
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,870
Fifteen years removed from any kind of political activity and was nearing the completion

396
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,550
of his first volume of capital when a French anarchist acquaintance came round looking

397
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,010
for Germans to attend a meeting in a week's time at St..

398
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:09,670
MARTIN tall to join the disparate and separate forces who stood opposed to the political

399
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,370
and more importantly economic status quo.

400
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:18,370
Marx suggested a friend of his who was actually a worker but he went along to the meeting

401
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:23,830
himself his intellectual reputation had been boosted by a contribution to the critique of

402
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:30,190
political economy. But among emigre radicals he was still mostly known as an old 1848 or

403
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,960
who had pissed everyone off and then retreated to the library to be an intellectual grump

404
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,520
who never hung out with anyone never really learned English and wasn't on speaking terms

405
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:45,950
with most of the other Germans so that is how Karl Marx came to join the International

406
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:52,130
Working Men's Association marking his return to active leftwing politics and giving him a

407
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,100
vehicle for his more mature and developed theories.

408
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,960
And next week we will talk about those more mature and developed theories because they

409
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,650
are going to be so important to nearly all revolutions going forward.

410
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:08,750
Historical materialism class conflict the proletariat and the bourgeoisie modes of

411
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:14,570
production and most especially how this would fit with the never ending question of how

412
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:20,450
to turn the world upside down or in the estimation of Marx right side.
