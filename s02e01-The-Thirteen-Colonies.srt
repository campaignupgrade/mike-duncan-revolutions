00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,500
This time, I'm going to go with a double feature as both will be relevant for our latest

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,400
revolution 1776 by David McCullough, recommended by listener MC Sean and Common Sense by

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,460
Thomas Paine, recommended by listener Mia L..

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,560
Hopefully I'm pronouncing both of those right.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,500
I haven't actually read 1776, but McCullough's other stuff has always been top notch and

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,390
common sense is, of course, one of the foundational texts of the American Revolution and

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,370
everyone ought to go through it at least once.

17

So when you're done with this episode, go to audible podcast dot com forward slash

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,410
revolutions so that they know who sent you.

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,670
Hello and welcome to revolutions.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,630
Episode 17.

21
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,780
Ok. Welcome back to the show.

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,820
We are now, as you know, jumping a hundred years forward and three thousand miles to the

23
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,190
left to play out the tumultuous drama of the American Revolution, a tumultuous drama that

24
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,620
occasionally parallels and sometimes even explicitly recalls the tumultuous drama of the

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,840
English Revolution. But before we can get into the guts of it, we need to do a survey of

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,430
the stage and the players.

27
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:10,090
So today we'll do a quick and necessarily blunt tour of colonial North America who live

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,830
there. Why did they live there?

29
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,960
What did they do when they got there?

30
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,250
Then we can get into the good stuff about the colonists going crazy after parliament

31
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,790
started randomly taxing stuff at the end of the French and Indian War.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,630
Broadly speaking, we divide the future United States into three big colonial chunks.

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,480
New England, the middle colonies and the southern colonies above New England was French

34
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,360
Canada and below Georgia with Spanish Florida.

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,740
There is a map of all this that revolutions podcast dot com.

36
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,390
For those of you who would like to follow along at home.

37
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,550
Now, each of these colonial regions was settled at a different time and for different

38
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,960
reasons. And on the eve of the revolution, the inhabitants of each lived very different

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,980
lives from one another.

40
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,180
Indeed, one of the great feats of the revolution was binding together.

41
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,130
The separate colonies into a single unit, something many revolutionary leaders feared was

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,030
impossible starting up in the North.

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,970
We have New England, which includes Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode

44
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,230
Island. These days, New England also includes Maine and Vermont.

45
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,430
But on the eve of the revolution, Maine was still a part of Massachusetts, and Vermont

46
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,870
was populated by a bunch of unruly squatters who had not yet succeeded in breaking away

47
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,480
from New York. For our purposes, colonization of New England is a nice place to start

48
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,770
because it is an offshoot of the same Puritan movement that eventually led to the English

49
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,240
civil wars that we just covered.

50
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,810
Shortly after King James, the first came to power, a group of Puritan separatists decided

51
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,550
they couldn't hack the ungodly ways of the Church of England anymore and decamped for the

52
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,410
Netherlands. But a decade in Holland only convinced this congregation that Dutch was a

53
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,820
really hard language to learn.

54
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,730
And my 16/17, they got it into their heads to maybe start over again in the new world, as

55
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,290
we'll see in a moment. The English had by now planted a permanent settlement at Jamestown

56
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,630
in Virginia, and the Puritan dissenters applied for and received permission to set up a

57
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,550
colony of their own in Virginia.

58
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,340
But of course, when the first hundred colonists known to all American schoolchildren as

59
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,350
the pilgrims set sail on the Mayflower and 16 twenty, they were blown off course and

60
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,430
wound up landing on Cape Cod instead.

61
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,070
Undeterred, they elected to stay and found the Plymouth comedy.

62
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,410
The early years were, of course, tough for our fanatical Puritans, but with the help of

63
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,520
some friendly American Indians, they managed to survive, establish the permanence of the

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,270
colony and invite their brethren to follow and follow.

65
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,200
Their brethren did between sixteen, twenty eight and sixteen forty two.

66
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,860
About twenty thousand Puritans abandoned England for the new world.

67
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,440
And of course, as we all know by now, that period corresponds exactly to the era of

68
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,910
personal rule when both the monarchy and the church started drifting in a tyrannical

69
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,280
direction, at least according to the pittance.

70
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,050
There is even a nice little story that I passed over that during the early days of the

71
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,840
long parliament. An obscure backbench MP all over Craughwell noted that had Parliament

72
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,430
not passed the grand remonstrance in sixteen forty two, that he and his friends were

73
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,680
prepared to pack up and move to America, which means that world history was about 10

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,940
votes shy of all over Kromm while becoming an American as the Puritan diaspora continued

75
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,080
through the sixteen thirties.

76
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,690
The other core New England colonies were founded.

77
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,280
Connecticut came along officially in sixteen thirty six, founded by men looking for a

78
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,550
little more religious freedom than the men running Massachusetts allowed.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,720
Because remember, religious freedom doesn't really mean religious freedom.

80
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,870
Shortly thereafter, the Earl of Work granted a patent to Lordes Brooke, and saying cele

81
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,720
to establish a settlement in Connecticut called Saybrook.

82
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,250
And as you'll recall, all three of those guys were in the inner circle of the

83
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,760
parliamentary revolt against Charles the first.

84
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,420
So the connections between New England and the men who were about to start a war with the

85
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,700
king ran very deep.

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,870
The little colony of Rhode Island was also founded in 16 36 by a guy named Roger

87
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,070
Williams, who was looking for more religious freedom than the men running Massachusetts

88
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,900
allowed. Rhode Island was the smallest colony and is the smallest state.

89
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,640
And it wound up being populated by a group of obnoxious free thinkers who just didn't fit

90
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,970
in anywhere else. As a result, Rhode Island tended to go its own way, as we will see.

91
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,590
They were very difficult to convince of the utility of non importation agreements.

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,000
They were the first colony then to declare independence from Britain and the last state

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,110
to ratify the U.S.

94
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,950
Constitution. There is just no accounting for Rhode Island.

95
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,550
Finally, we have New Hampshire, which started being settled shortly after Massachusetts

96
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,700
and basically became its own thing after 16 twenty nine.

97
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,500
Though the on-again off-again political connection to Massachusetts wouldn't be settled

98
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,910
until 16 ninety one.

99
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,040
New Hampshire was defined predominantly by small farming hamlets cut off from each other

100
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,050
by the local terrain economically.

101
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,100
The New England colonies were limited by the harsh land they planted themselves on, land

102
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,450
that would never support the kind of huge cash crop plantations that were growing up in

103
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,130
the southern colonies. So through the colonial period, they survived on small plots of

104
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,630
land for food and started to engage in trans-Atlantic trade with England, mostly

105
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,080
providing fish, lumber and fur to the mother country.

106
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,800
Through it all, the New Englanders a setting.

107
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,050
Rhode Island, of course, ran quasi democratic communities dominated by church leaders who

108
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,500
were trying to put into practice beliefs that had been stifled in England.

109
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,300
There were more than a few Puritans on both side of the Atlantic who saw the colonies as

110
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,270
a laboratory for ideas that could be put into practice.

111
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,320
Back in England. But of course, the restoration put an end to all that.

112
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,790
And rather than being the vanguard of a pure revolution in England, New England became

113
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,770
something of a time capsule as England resettled into its old, familiar traditions.

114
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,980
The dominant city of New England was, of course, Boston first settled in 16:30 and soon

115
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,450
became one of the main trading centres in North America as the surrounding towns and

116
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,830
villages shipped their produce overland to Boston for transit back to England.

117
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,020
On the eve of the revolution, Boston had a population of about 15000 and believe it or

118
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,930
not, they were not all fire-breathing radicals.

119
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,800
Moving south, we find the middle colonies, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and

120
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,100
Delaware. The middle colonies were settled under very different circumstances from New

121
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,730
England and under different circumstances from each other.

122
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,590
New York was, of course, initially populated by the Dutch who arrived in 16 13.

123
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,650
In between the founding of Jamestown and the founding of Plymouth, Dutch interest was

124
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,880
focused on the fur trade.

125
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,230
And they built a series of forts up the Hudson River to barter with the native Indians

126
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,980
for the lucrative furs in sixteen twenty six.

127
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,900
The leader of the Dutch merchants allegedly purchased the island of Manhattan for 60

128
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,760
Dutch guilders. Though the details of that deal are way more complicated than the old

129
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,420
legend about buying Manhattan for twenty four dollars worth of beads.

130
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,580
Anyway, the Dutch built New Amsterdam on the southern tip of the island serve as the

131
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,290
capital of the New Netherlands.

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,640
But the Dutch hold in North America was always precarious.

133
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,780
And after a series of wars with Britain, the New Netherlands were handed over to the

134
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,530
English in 16 74.

135
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,800
In exchange, the Dutch got to hold Suriname, which probably seemed like a better deal at

136
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,450
the time than it does today.

137
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,990
The English promptly renamed Everything New York after James Duke of York The Future

138
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,540
James the Second. Aside from the trade operating out of the now renamed New York City,

139
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,060
the economy of New York was dominated by huge, essentially feudal estates up the Hudson

140
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,710
River, where the landlords were able to wield extensive legal power over their tenants.

141
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,910
South of New York was New Jersey.

142
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,640
Starting in 16 38, the area was actually colonized by the Swedes and called New Sweden

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,220
until it was absorbed by the Dutch in 16 55, who then handed it over to the English in 16

144
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,480
74. King Charles, the second then gave it to his brother James as a gift.

145
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,120
And James turned the territory into a proprietary colony wherein huge tracts of land are

146
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,800
handed over to individuals or corporations who then act as a sort of private government.

147
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:50,280
Colonial New Jersey wound up being defined by a running conflict between small holding

148
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,630
farmers who trace their claims back to the initial Dutch and Swedish settlements and the

149
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,310
newly arrived English aristocracy who traced their claims to the proprietary grants from

150
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:05,880
the King. It was a conflict that would run right into and then get merged with the unrest

151
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,310
of the revolution. New Jersey would be reorganized as a royal colony.

152
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,950
That is one directly under the crown in 1:43, which I mention, so that I can mention that

153
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,290
the first royal governor of New Jersey was none other than Edward Hyde, the third Earl of

154
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,270
Clarendon, grandson of the Edward Hyde, who was so instrumental in the history of the

155
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,290
English Revolution.

156
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,940
Of course, this Edward Hyde wound up being so corrupt that he was stripped of his title

157
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,740
in 1788, whereupon New Jersey was governed by New York for the next 30 years.

158
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,230
Speaking of proprietary colonies, the biggest was established right next door to New

159
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:50,020
Jersey in sixteen eighty one to clear out old debts to the Penn family.

160
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,270
Charles the second granted William Penn control of an enormous tract of land in the new

161
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,790
world, making pan.

162
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,870
the single largest landowner in terms of square miles of any man in the British Empire.

163
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,980
William Penn was also a Quaker, one of those dissenting sacks that had flourished in the

164
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,870
chaos of 17th century England.

165
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,220
But now, though, the Quakers were defined mostly by their quiet pacifism.

166
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,050
And it was along those lines that Penn founded his colony, achieving probably the most

167
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,280
enlightened relationship with the native Indians of any of the North American colonies.

168
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,700
Though in time that pacifism became a huge sticking point because many of the settlers

169
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,770
who started filling up the colony were not Quakers.

170
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,420
Many indeed were German Lutherans settling on the western edges who dealt constantly with

171
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,150
Indian attacks. The tension within Pennsylvania between the Quaker leadership and

172
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,920
everyone else came to a head in a series of political battles that saw the Quakers

173
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,300
essentially admit that their principles were incompatible with the rough business of

174
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,380
actual governance.

175
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,380
Pennsylvania also boasted the city of Philadelphia, which on the eve of the revolution

176
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:05,740
had a population just north of 30000, was the largest and most cosmopolitan city in North

177
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,600
America, thanks in no small part to the efforts of its most famous citizen, Benjamin

178
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,310
Franklin, who I assure you we are about to have extensive dealings with.

179
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,840
The last of the middle colonies was Delaware and is the one that earns you trivia.

180
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,670
Bonus points, if you say that technically there were only 12 original colonies, not 13,

181
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,540
because Delaware, known as the three lower counties, were included in the sixteen eighty

182
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,200
one land grant to William Penn.

183
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,060
Though Penn quickly saw the utility of allowing the lower counties their own legislative

184
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,950
assembly, its attachment to Pennsylvania was always a little strange because as you can

185
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,820
see from the map, if anything, Delaware should have been a part of Maryland.

186
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,070
But it wasn't. And though it was technically a part of Pennsylvania, it achieved more

187
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,370
than enough de facto autonomy to be considered by everyone.

188
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,550
Both past and present to be its own colony.

189
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,040
The economy of the middle colonies was a mix of agriculture and trade.

190
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,600
The land was better than New England, and the barons of Hudson Valley, for example, were

191
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,060
able to run their operations like little kingdoms.

192
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,280
The Western frontier became populated with smallholder farmers, while the coastal areas

193
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,390
became dominated by merchants operating out of New York City and Philadelphia.

194
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920
These two groups did not necessarily see eye to eye on how to run things.

195
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,950
The Western farmers always chafing under the thumb of the coastal elites.

196
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,020
That is to say, nothing, of course, of the battles fought between the colonies themselves

197
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,570
over boundary lines and access to resources as migrating families simply settled places

198
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,910
and dared anyone to try to kick them off.

199
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,250
So finally, we come to the southern colonies, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina

200
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,600
and Georgia, with Maryland sort of hanging out as a border state.

201
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,910
The southern colonies, of course, developed a very different and far more pernicious

202
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,860
social and economic life.

203
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,800
But even still, there were differences among them.

204
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,960
First, we'll clear out the unique border colony of Maryland.

205
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,850
The land for which was handed over to the family of Lord Baltimore in 16 32.

206
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,000
Lord Baltimore was a devout Catholic, and he saw Maryland, which was probably named after

207
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,950
Queen Henrietta Maria, Catholic, wife of Charles, the first as a refuge for his rich

208
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,110
Catholic buddies. Because as much as the Puritans of England saw King Charles and

209
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,790
Archbishop Lott engaged in some popish plot, the Catholics of England knew better.

210
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,880
And like the Puritans on the other side of the religious spectrum.

211
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,960
Lord Baltimore saw the new world as a place to escape persecution.

212
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,080
But soon enough that original intent was washed away by the flood of Protestant settlers.

213
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,790
Coming up mostly from Virginia.

214
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,480
By sixteen forty nine, Baltimore had to give way, and he granted freedom of worship,

215
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,730
making Maryland the second colony after, you guessed it, Rhode Island to do so.

216
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,100
The great colony of the South and indeed the great colony of British North America was,

217
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,240
of course, Virginia, occasionally known as the Prussia of America.

218
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,170
By the time of the revolution, it would be the oldest, largest, richest and most populous

219
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,430
colony in North America.

220
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,770
And its leaders knew it.

221
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,030
After the mysterious false start that is the lost colony of Roanoke, a new settlement

222
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,200
called Jamestown was constructed beside the James River in 6:44.

223
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,690
For those of you who are interested in the whole sordid history of early Virginia should

224
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,460
read American Slavery, American Freedom by Edmund Morgan, which has surprisingly little

225
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,990
to say about slavery, but a great deal about the struggles, failures and hardships of

226
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,210
seventeenth century Virginia, including their persistent inability to grow enough food to

227
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,380
live despite having planted themselves in some of the most fertile soil in the world.

228
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,080
Initially, this was the result of the colonists themselves, a mix of indentured servants

229
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,620
and gentleman adventurers just not doing what it took to survive.

230
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,870
But then John Roffe discovered the miracle of tobacco, which became the cash crop of

231
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,890
British North America.

232
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,700
From then on, it wasn't so much about screwing around when you were supposed to be

233
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,650
working so much as refusing to be distracted from tobacco long enough to grow some food.

234
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:29,560
So early Virginia was a mess, but by the seventeen hundreds it had established itself as

235
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,480
the Old Dominion. And more than any other colony resembled the socioeconomic structure of

236
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,860
England with large landowners, really a collection of about one hundred families

237
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,440
dominating a population of indebted freeholders, indentured servants and African slaves.

238
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:50,290
These large landowners propped up the established Anglican Church, Virginia being the one

239
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,020
place in North America that the Church of England really took root.

240
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,000
And they all believe mightily in their rights as Englishmen, especially their right as

241
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,230
gentlemen landlords.

242
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,500
But the truly defining feature of economic life in Virginia, besides the complete

243
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,170
reliance on tobacco as both export commodity and means of internal exchange, was that

244
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:16,060
everyone from the largest plantation owner to the smallest little freeholder was deeply

245
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,410
in debt. Everyone bought on liberally extended credit from England.

246
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,380
They would always come due with the next tobacco crop.

247
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,650
And this caused more than a little tension.

248
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:34,600
I promise you. South of Virginia were the Carolinas founded in sixteen twenty nine and

249
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,850
named after our old friend Charles the first.

250
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,110
Carolina was established initially as one big proprietary colony.

251
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,210
But in 1712, the disaffected northern settlements broke away and the territory was

252
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,210
reformed as North Carolina and South Carolina.

253
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,010
Initially, the Carolinas followed the Virginia path in to plantation tobacco with a

254
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,170
smattering of pitch and lumber thrown in there.

255
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,880
But eventually South Carolina became deeply involved in the cultivation of rice in

256
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,940
Indigo. A newly discovered plant that was being used for dye, both commodities unique to

257
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,360
South Carolina will become sticking points in the Continental Congress.

258
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,180
As the Pan Colonial Alliance was taking shape.

259
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,870
South Carolina also house.

260
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,680
The only real city in the South Charleston.

261
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,230
Named after Guess Who, which grew to about 10000 people as the revolution broke out.

262
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,540
Now, the reason the southern colonies never developed major urban centers like the

263
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,880
northern colonies did was because the region had so many deep navigable rivers that any

264
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,530
landowner could just throw up a dock without needing to ship his commodity overland to a

265
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,600
central hub like they had to do up in the north with Boston, New York or Philadelphia.

266
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,970
South of the Carolinas was Georgia the last colony established, not founded until 1733.

267
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,850
Georgia was a proprietary colony dreamed up by James Oglethorpe and a group of benevolent

268
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,340
utopians who saw the colony as a way to rehabilitate and put to good use the desperate

269
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,390
poor of England.

270
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:13,110
But their excruciatingly detailed plans for how land would be allocated, what you could

271
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:19,170
grow, what you could import, and what you could export ran smack into the reality of,

272
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,990
well, life in Georgia, which was, for example, not conducive to growing silk, which the

273
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,090
proprietors of Georgia were convinced the colony ought to be hemorrhaging by now, facing

274
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,410
almost certain destruction.

275
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,750
Many of the poor colonies shipped over found life in Oglethorpe Utopia dangerously rigid

276
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,660
and fled to the relative freedom of Carolina.

277
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,450
The proprietors of Georgia finally gave up and 1752 and handed control of the colony back

278
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:52,020
to the crown. So in broad terms, that covers where the colonies came from, then a little

279
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,470
bit of what they were up to economically by the time the revolution broke out.

280
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,510
It is important to always remember as we walk through this, though, that the colonies

281
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:05,460
were very much separate entities from each other and they bickered constantly over land

282
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,710
and boundaries and access to resources, really only their shared attachment to England

283
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,010
uniting them. But there was at least one big similarity between them all their distance

284
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,060
from the mother country and said mother country's disinterest in them.

285
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,800
After all, we are talking about a collection of dissenters, secretaries and poor debtors

286
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,820
led them all to enjoy a great deal of local political autonomy.

287
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:35,580
Every colony had some kind of central assembly that engaged in practical administration,

288
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,720
dispensing of justice and, of course, taxing the inhabitants.

289
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,070
It should not be underestimated just how much the roughly century and a half of English

290
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,980
neglect influenced the course of the American Revolution.

291
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,370
It certainly helped transform some pretty innocuous taxes into a belief that tyranny and

292
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,320
slavery were just around the corner.

293
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,770
And that Segways us nicely into a discussion of the two groups we haven't talked about

294
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,990
yet, but who represent the deep hypocrisy that unfortunately lies at the heart of the

295
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,160
American Revolution.

296
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,580
Slaves and American Indians.

297
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,590
How can we reconcile the ideology of liberty and equality that fueled the revolution with

298
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,630
an all but genocidal policy towards the Indians and the stark reality of African slavery?

299
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,140
The answer is you can't really.

300
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,820
At least I can't. It's just something that is unavoidably there to take the American

301
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,160
Indians first. We obviously can't dive into a comprehensive history of native peoples in

302
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,450
the new world because for one, we're talking about dozens of individual tribes and

303
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:51,540
nations ranging from frozen Canada down to swampy Florida, the Iroquois, Shawnee,

304
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,520
Cherokee. These are all major nations with rich and unique histories all their own.

305
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,070
But what they shared in common was an encounter with Europeans that generally followed a

306
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,410
similar trajectory in all the colonies.

307
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,870
The first white men appear in small numbers and find themselves incapable of surviving in

308
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:15,060
the new world. These helpless colonists make contact with the local tribes and often

309
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,400
begin exchanging commercial products for food.

310
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,710
Once the European settlers establish themselves, more colonists arrive.

311
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,520
Indian land is encroached upon, leading to internment and an increasingly bitter

312
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,340
skirmishes and or massacres on both sides.

313
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,550
Then a combination of numbers, firepower and disease lead the Europeans to pretty quickly

314
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,730
get the upper hand and the Indians get pushed west.

315
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,640
By the mid seventeen hundreds, the Indians have been pretty well pushed off the eastern

316
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,710
seaboard, but they were able to maintain some kind of independence sovereignty by playing

317
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,540
the British off the French.

318
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,850
As long as there were two imperial powers competing for the fur trade and the affection

319
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,790
of the tribes. There was hope of national survival.

320
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,920
Certainly hope that the British American colonists would be confined to the land east of

321
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,060
the Appalachian Mountains.

322
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,060
This is what led the majority of Indians to fight with the French in the American theater

323
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,140
of the Seven Years War, which were about to talk about, and then hop over to side with

324
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,240
the British during the American Revolution.

325
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,430
Because, to put it bluntly, the worst case scenario for the Indians was to be left alone

326
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:28,590
on the continent with the Americans who were hungry for land and never really felt too

327
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,370
constrained by moral or political duty when it came to the Indians.

328
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,380
The subsequent history of Indian American relations, I think pretty well establishes that

329
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,810
those fears were not at all misplaced.

330
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:48,630
The other great hypocrisy deep in the heart of the revolution is, of course, slavery at

331
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,680
the time of the revolution.

332
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,530
There were about four hundred thousand slaves living in the U.S.,

333
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,810
mostly in the southern colonies.

334
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,640
They had been present from almost the beginning with the first nineteen Africans arriving

335
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,380
in Virginia in sixteen nineteen.

336
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,690
But for the rest of the century, African slavery was more of a supplement to the far more

337
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,110
common use of indentured servants as the colonial labor force.

338
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,990
Since mortality rates were so high in colonial America, it was cheaper to pay for seven

339
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,870
years labor than a lifetime of labor.

340
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,170
Since the labor was going to be dead in three years anyway.

341
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,150
But once mortality rates began to improve, it became increasingly common to invest in a

342
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,470
slave for life, since you would never have to let them go, nor deal with the pressure

343
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,700
from ex indentured servants who now wanted land and political rights.

344
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,150
So by seventeen hundred, the African slaves that had been getting mostly shipped to work

345
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,830
in the horrific sugar plantations of the British West Indies started being funneled north

346
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,000
to work the estates of major landowners, the kind of guys who could actually scrape

347
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,220
together enough cash to buy a slave.

348
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:59,690
Now, this point has been made 10000 times before, so there is no reason to belabor it,

349
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,660
but basically all the southern leaders of the American Revolution were slave holders and

350
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,910
they weren't conservative fence sitters either.

351
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,560
I mean, we're talking about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, George

352
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,360
Mason, James Madison.

353
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,850
These were the guys who defined American liberty, fought a war to protect American

354
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,510
liberty, and then built a new government to preserve American liberty.

355
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,880
And they all owned slaves.

356
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,910
It's ridiculous. Now, had these guys followed through on the logic of their own argument

357
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:37,100
to its conclusion, that is that all men are created equal and like freed their slaves,

358
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,910
that is, had George Washington issued the Emancipation Proclamation.

359
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,770
The American Revolution would have been the greatest historical event in world history,

360
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,830
simultaneously tossing off the archaic bonds of monarchy and the evil chains of slavery.

361
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,640
But they simply couldn't see a way out of the economic implications of emancipation.

362
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,480
So the legacy of the revolution remains forever tarnished.

363
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,990
We'll wrap up today with the war to set the stage for the conflict between Britain and

364
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,900
her North American colonies in the United States.

365
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,400
We call it the French and Indian War.

366
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,070
It is known elsewhere as the Seven Years War.

367
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,930
A wide ranging conflict between France and Britain, which North America was simply one

368
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:27,140
theater of the war, technically started in 1754, but had been in the making for some

369
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:32,850
time. As the British began to colonize North America, the French got in on the action and

370
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,760
established a foothold in the far north along the St.

371
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,960
Lawrence River from their main bases in Quebec City and Montreal.

372
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,330
They grew up a primarily fur based trade network that extended deep into the interior.

373
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,370
Now, though, it took a while.

374
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,020
Eventually, British Colonial started pushing West in search of more land, and they ran up

375
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,240
against the French traders in the Ohio Valley.

376
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,230
Both sides claim sovereignty over the land and the local Indians were caught in the

377
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:06,010
middle. The resulting war is intricate enough and dramatic enough to sustain a multi

378
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:11,800
episode arc all its own from Braddock's initial disastrous march to Wolf's final victory

379
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,870
at the plains of Abraham. But for our purposes, we need only note that the British won

380
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:23,470
and the French lost. The final peace was signed in Paris in 1763, leaving the British in

381
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,470
sole control of North America.

382
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:32,770
The story of the American Revolution begins just as the ink is drying on the Treaty of

383
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:38,770
Paris. The cost of the war and the cost of their empire let Britain's political

384
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:44,530
leadership, both in parliament and the royal ministry to re-evaluate how that empire was

385
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:50,850
governed and financed, in many ways, their goal was both prudent and far sighted.

386
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,200
Make the colonies self-sufficient.

387
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,540
But the instruments they devised to achieve this goal were heavy handed, the manner they

388
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,590
were employed, clumsy.

389
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,880
The justifications offered downright arrogant.

390
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,510
So the story of the American Revolution owes at least as much to British bungling as it

391
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,590
does to American bravery patriotism valor etc.

392
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,860
etc. etc.

393
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:22,680
So next week we will kick things off with the first of two episodes covering the 17 60s

394
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,760
and early 70s 70s which saw American anger expand and contract in turn.

395
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,640
As the Stamp Act was passed and repealed the towns and Acts were passed and mostly

396
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,990
repealed and then the Tea Act was passed and now by then things had gotten out of hand.

397
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,370
Then we will move on into the campaigns of the Revolutionary War.

398
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,960
On our way to American independence and then finally the ratification of the United

399
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,820
States Constitution does either the ultimate embodiment of the ideals of the revolution

400
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,840
or an abject betrayal of the ideals of the revolution.

401
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,300
Depending on who you talk to.
