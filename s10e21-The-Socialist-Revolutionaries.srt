00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,700
strong yet flexible public carbonate and anodized aluminum.

the metro and trains and in and out of planes.

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,020
And on more than one occasion, that battery has saved me from a dying cell phone with no

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,580

Hello and welcome to revolutions.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,910
Episode ten point twenty one The Socialist Revolutionaries.

28
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,040
Last time we talked through the liberal or at least liberal ish tradition of 19th century

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,560
Russia, however thin the thread winds are, Nicholas the second ascended the throne in

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,020
1894. There was a group inside the intelligentsia who hoped the arrival of a young new

31
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,630
monarch would bring liberal political reform.

32
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,060
A Constitution representative government.

33
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,400
Freedom of speech. And the press and assembly.

34
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,680
Something resembling the rule of law.

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,030
Economic modernisation.

36
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,130
Social improvement.

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,880
They were as grossed out as any radical by the chauvinist stick authoritarian and

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,720
backwards triptych of orthodoxy, autocracy and nationality.

39
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,440
It embarrass them abroad and humiliated them at home.

40
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,960
But those liberals were always going to want to stop well short of the places more

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,020
radical leaders wanted to take Russia in the 1890s.

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,600
Whether these new groups of Marxist Social Democrats or the groups we're gonna talk about

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:58,150
today, the neo narrowest socialist revolutionaries or as everyone calls them, the S Rs.

44
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,570
To begin this discussion, we need to back up to the late 1870s in 1879, the terrorism

45
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,700
question divided the once unified Land and Liberty Party into two factions the small

46
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,860
minority who followed Tarnoff into the splinter group Black repartition, which then wound

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,960
up breaking with the protest ideology entirely when they formed the explicitly Marxist

48
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,640
emancipation of labor group.

49
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,200
In 1884.

50
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,320
But the majority of land in liberty had done what?

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,330
That's right. They embraced the terrorist campaign, redoubled themselves.

52
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,790
People's will, and went off to kill the Tsar.

53
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,980
Finally succeeding in 1881.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,740
But what happened to them after that?

55
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,510
Well, as I mentioned somewhat obliquely in episode ten point sixteen and ten point

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,130
seventeen, the People's Will organization was almost immediately smashed and scattered by

57
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,940
the vengeful fist of the krona, the TSA's new Secret Police Service.

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,550
The members of people's will were hunted, arrested, tried by military tribunals, and then

59
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,870
either hanged or exiled.

60
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,880
Those who slipped this round up were forced into exile, taking off for Switzerland or

61
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,680
France or Britain. A few stayed behind and dug in even harder on terrorists campaigning.

62
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,610
But Thorold networks were so disruptive and the repressive hand of the new czar,

63
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,770
Alexander the third was so heavy that it was nearly impossible to meet publisher plan.

64
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:26,100
So they're a great prize for successfully killing the Tsar was the destruction of their

65
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:34,260
party. Not only were the 1880s a low point for radical new road ism in terms of literal

66
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,270
personnel and party organization, but it also seemed like their ideas and theories were

67
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,730
dead too, because what was the main organizing principle behind people's will when those

68
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,450
critical years leading up to the assassination of Czar Alexander the Second?

69
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,280
Well, first, while they fought for the peasants and wanted to base future Russian

70
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,980
socialism in the rural villages, the peasantry was at present too hopelessly smothered by

71
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,650
the repressive imperial government to rise up en masse.

72
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,540
It would only be after the political war against the Tsarist state was won, that the

73
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,600
peasants could be freed and rural socialism could flourish.

74
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,820
Now one of the main arguments in favor of an assassination campaign carried out by an

75
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,670
elite Cordray of revolutionary terrorists was that it would deal a fatal physical and

76
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,880
psychic blow to the forces of political despotism.

77
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,400
On the physical level, this was very much a kill the head and the body dies kind of

78
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,520
thing. But on the psychic level, on an almost cosmic level, assassinating the czar would

79
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,650
prove that the czar was just a man after all, not some divine demigod, and the

80
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,240
superstitious peasants would then be roused from their fearful and superstitious stupor.

81
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,320
So on both a practical and a spiritual level, killing the czar was supposed to

82
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,660
simultaneously cause the imperial apparatus to fall apart and trigger the people to rise

83
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,170
up, and then people's will did it.

84
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,810
They killed the czar. And what happened?

85
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,640
Pretty much the opposite.

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,220
The repressive Imperial Police state only spread wider and drove deeper and ask for the

87
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,560
peasants. They did nothing.

88
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,800
They were seemingly as inert and apathetic as ever.

89
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,480
Certainly there was no mass insurrection accompanying the death of Czar Alexander, the

90
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:27,070
second kind of disproving and discrediting all the strategic, tactical and ideological

91
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,920
assumptions that peoples well had been operating under.

92
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,390
Not leads of what might seem like a pretty straight historical story for the evolution of

93
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,000
Russian radicalism at the end of the 19th century.

94
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:46,260
The nihilism of the 1860s had led to the mass mobilization going to the people of 1874,

95
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,200
which failed, giving way to the elite terrorism of people's will, which was exposed as

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,140
fatally flawed in 1881, paving the way for the exciting new brand of Russian Marxism to

97
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,540
pick up the fallen torch in the 1890s.

98
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,530
And this is what happened. Well, yes.

99
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,170
And now everything I just said definitely led a new generation of radicals to be drawn to

100
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,000
the Marxist ideas being disseminated by the emancipation of labor group, because Marxist

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,900
analysis was going to make a lot of sense against the backdrop of the rapid

102
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,970
industrialization of the Vitesse system.

103
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,480
But neuroticism did not die in the 1880s.

104
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,850
It simply went into hibernation.

105
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,430
And when it emerged from its slumber in the 1890s, it still found a lot of enthusiastic

106
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,050
adherents. Not for the least reason that even with the rapid industrialization of the

107
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,300
Vitesse system, the empire was still overwhelmingly rural, agrarian and peasant.

108
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,380
The revival of the fortunes of neuroticism can be traced to two coinciding events in the

109
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,610
early 1890s.

110
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,110
The first was the famine of 1891 1892.

111
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,910
That we talked about an episode ten point eighteen bad harvests led to frightening

112
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,950
scarcity and then outright famine, which resulted in the deaths of upwards of 500000

113
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,170
people. The government was simply unprepared and unequipped to deal with the crisis.

114
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,420
And while people's will theory had been if we killed the Tsar, maybe the people will lose

115
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,450
faith in the Tsar. There was now a new revelation.

116
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,760
If the czar lets the people die, then maybe the people will lose faith in the czar.

117
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,590
The experience of mass starvation caused by bad luck, but exacerbated by incompetence,

118
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,790
indifference or outright malevolence by the Tsarist imperial apparatus.

119
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,330
It was a real blow to the regime's perceived legitimacy.

120
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,600
Old Neruda's veterans of the 1870s, working among the peasants in the 1890s, remarked how

121
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,500
much more open and receptive they were to radical critiques of the government.

122
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,880
So going to the people had failed in 1874, but suddenly it was maybe an idea whose time

123
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,040
had come. By 1894.

124
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,270
And speaking of those Naruto's veterans, they are the other coinciding event of the early

125
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:10,580
1890s. Many of those who had been tried and convicted of various crimes back in the

126
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:16,400
1870s, like those convicted in the famous trial of 193, were now completing their

127
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,510
sentences of Siberian exile and returning home by the early 1890s.

128
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:27,020
Then in his benevolent generosity, when Tsar Nicholas the second ascended the throne, he

129
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,910
marked the occasion by granting wide reaching amnesties and pardons that invited former

130
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,010
political prisoners to rejoin society.

131
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,940
Now, sure, many of those who returned were like, okay, that's all in the past.

132
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,320
Siberia sucked. I have paid for my youthful follies and I would like to just go home now,

133
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,590
please. But plenty of those returning had changed, not one jot, and they had spent their

134
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,550
years either in prison or in exile, simply biding their time.

135
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,770
And because they had gone into isolation, holding old in protest ideas, they came out of

136
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,830
that isolation, holding those same old ideas.

137
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,580
They missed the memo that their ideas had been discredited.

138
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,700
That narrowed ism in the rural peasants were old news.

139
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,360
The future belonged to the Marxists and the urban proletariat.

140
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,700
Now they were not insensible to the fact that conditions in the 1890s were not what they

141
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,320
had been in the 1870s, and that past experience and new ideas would mean some of the

142
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,930
program would need to be adapted or revised.

143
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,110
But still, they had no intention of being merely a stepping stone on the road to Marxist

144
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,610
proletarian revolution.

145
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,580
OK, so what we are up to specifically in this week's episode is setting up the formation

146
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,300
of the coming Socialist Revolutionary Party in January of 1982.

147
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,100
So what we're gonna spend the rest of today talking about are the four distinct groups

148
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,010
who would start coming together independently of each other.

149
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,700
In the mid 1890s, who would go on to form the core of that socialist revolutionary party.

150
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,270
These groups formed organically and separately, often starting with one or two people

151
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,830
deciding one day to get a little group together, maybe to educate the workers or the

152
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:15,020
peasants, maybe to offer reading material and discussion space for students, maybe to try

153
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,900
to link with like minded members of the intelligentsia.

154
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,430
These groups or self-starting and self-funded.

155
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,070
They were often a mix of old veterans and young upstarts.

156
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,840
They were never very big.

157
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,150
7 people here.

158
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,800
A dozen people there, 50 at most.

159
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,750
But what they all had in common is that they were working in the old neuritis tradition.

160
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,060
Well, Matt. And they were all destined to feed into the S Rs.

161
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,070
So the first group we'll talk about is called the Union of Socialist Revolutionaries, but

162
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,420
they will be better known to history by the shorthand name the Northern Union.

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,310
And just as a general warning as we go forward, not just for today, but for the rest of

164
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,510
the series. All these people are going to be calling themselves the Socialist

165
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,460
Revolutionary Union and the Workers Union of Revolutionary Socialists and the Socialist

166
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,240
Revolutionary Party, as opposed to the Revolutionary Socialist Party as opposed to the

167
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,290
Party for Revolutionary Socialism as opposed to the Revolutionary Party of Socialists.

168
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,430
Don't worry too much about the names just now.

169
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,550
Just try to follow along with the ideas and the people who are participating in the

170
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:28,310
movement. So anyway, what becomes known as the Northern Union, formed in 1896 in the

171
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,350
southwestern city of sahÁtof, but moved its headquarters to Moscow the following year.

172
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,350
And just to remind you of the scale here, the Northern Union at its peak is only going to

173
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,390
have about 30 full fledged members.

174
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,580
Me organizing force behind the Northern Union was Andre Argan Off, who will be on the

175
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,790
Central Committee of the SRB come the revolution of 1985.

176
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,580
Born in 1866, he was too young to have been a part of the original run of peoples, well,

177
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:04,480
terrorism. But in his early 20s, Argonaut hooked up with the few 1880s holdouts in Tomsk

178
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,030
and then spent the early 1890s circulating among student groups, which led to the more

179
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,180
formal organization of the Northern Union a few years later.

180
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:20,240
When it was formed, the Northern Union represented the most unreconstructed ideological

181
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,390
continuity with the now defunct people's will.

182
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,900
aag enough would write a declaration of principles for the group in 1898 called Our

183
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,970
Tasks, which set out their political goals and tactical approach for the revolution.

184
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Both friends and rivals alike noted that it was cribbed almost entirely from similar

185
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,810
people's will declarations in the 1870s.

186
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,300
The argument was that though the peasants, the people would be the principal

187
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,500
beneficiaries of the revolution, they were not yet ready to carry out the revolution

188
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,530
themselves. They would not be able to overcome their poverty, ignorance and apathy until

189
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,600
the Tsarist apparatus had been brought down.

190
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,070
And the best way to attack and topple that apparatus was through violent terrorist

191
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,330
assassination campaigns.

192
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,070
Before there can be a social or economic revolution, there must first be a political

193
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,420
revolution carried out by diehard radicals inside the intelligentsia.

194
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,300
So this I mean, all of this I just said five minutes ago when I was talking about what

195
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,820
people's will believed and other groups, among them Neon A ROTAS and anarchists and

196
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,670
Marxist Social Democrats would read our tasks and find it full of tried and failed

197
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
Neruda's dogmatism.

198
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,490
While the Northern Union was getting going, there was another developmental pattern

199
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,350
centered, especially in Ukraine.

200
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,920
That is collectively referred to as the southern groups.

201
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:55,430
Unlike argand off and the Northern Union, the southern groups really leaned into the neo

202
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,340
part of neo narrowed ism and they adapted their program to a account for the failures of

203
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,360
the 1870s.

204
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:10,250
B Acknowledge the reality of Vitesse system Russia in the 1890s and c grappled directly

205
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,750
with the Marxist analysis now going mainstream inside radical circles.

206
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,940
On the matter of terrorism, they either tried to avoid directly taking a stand or coming

207
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,740
down firmly in opposition.

208
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,830
Terrorism and assassination might be viscerally exciting, but it had not and would not

209
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:35,180
get the job done. The southern groups were also recalculating the immediate revolutionary

210
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,460
potential of the peasants, while the old recycled people's will dogma that the Northern

211
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,210
Union was spouting said they can't be activated until the Tsar has been toppled.

212
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,450
The southern groups suspected that things had changed.

213
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,890
The times changed.

214
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,300
And then activating the peasants was not only possible, but necessary to carry out a

215
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,770
socialist revolution in Russia.

216
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,020
And they also agreed that a sure path to appealing to the workers and the peasants was to

217
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,130
focus on addressing their immediate concerns and grievances and then helping them

218
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,010
alleviate those immediate concerns and grievances.

219
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,270
But just as the southern groups criticized the Northern Union for reheating spoiled

220
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,040
potatoes, the Northern Union criticized the southern groups for splitting off from

221
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,240
narrowed ism entirely.

222
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,770
This isn't neon or ism.

223
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,180
This is something else entirely.

224
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,760
For example, one of the big features of neuroticism was a desire to either head off or

225
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,310
leapfrog over industrial capitalism, and the southern groups tended to accept the Marxist

226
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,110
position that capitalism was coming and that the urban proletariat might very well serve

227
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,600
as the advance guard of the next revolution.

228
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,720
On top of this heresy, they added another.

229
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,480
That willingness to talk about and improve living and working conditions was a break with

230
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,750
the core beliefs of both narrowed ism and Bakunin is anarchism.

231
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,360
Those guys wanted to reject capitalism, a root and branch and not sap the revolution of

232
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,000
its vitality by marginally improving the workers lives in exchange for tacitly accepting

233
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,680
this new capitalist system.

234
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,120
Putting padding on the chains does not break the chains.

235
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,560
But the southern groups were not closet Marxists.

236
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,470
In fact, they had more faith in the rural peasantry than the Northern Union did.

237
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,870
They still believe that the future of Russia was agrarian socialism and that the failure

238
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,160
of the going to the people should not be taken as permanent proof that a revolutionary

239
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,010
army would never come marching out of the rural countryside.

240
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:36,350
When they looked around in the mid 1890s, they noted that conditions had changed and

241
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:41,900
there were two new classes who provided an excellent opportunity to more efficiently and

242
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,910
productively focus recruitment, propaganda and education efforts on the peasants.

243
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,050
First there was the so-called rural intelligentsia.

244
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,930
And second, there was that large subset of the growing industrial working class who

245
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,480
regularly returned home to their native villages.

246
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,990
Neither of those classes had really existed back in the 1870s, but now they did.

247
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,910
And now they could be used.

248
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,630
As to the first class, this rural intelligentsia, the zemser wound up being the factory

249
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:22,860
that produced them. Remember, the Zemser were focused on creating schools and hospitals

250
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,680
and health services and improving local infrastructure.

251
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,530
So this drew out to more rural areas, educated professionals who used to be found only in

252
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,090
the bigger cities. Teachers, lawyers, engineers, doctors and so forth.

253
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,760
And then especially thanks to the educational improvements of the 1870s and 1880s.

254
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,200
You saw a new generation growing up much better educated than their parents.

255
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,190
Now, obviously, many people in this rural intelligentsia group are going to wind up

256
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,870
mostly in political sympathy with the liberal zemser for constitutionalists that we

257
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:01,360
talked about last week, but there were plenty with more radical ambitions, especially

258
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,830
among the teachers. They would start their own little reading, discussion and medication

259
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,190
all circles. Partly this was to alleviate boredom, but partly it was out of real zeal.

260
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,990
And you would see things like little lending libraries get organized that allowed the

261
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,370
increasingly literate local population to access new and interesting ideas.

262
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,020
And one of the great lessons learned of the failed going to the people was that the

263
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,890
people had not known or trusted the people who went to the people.

264
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,400
But the rural intelligentsia was engaged with far more permanent cohabitation and they

265
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,500
were identified as the perfect bridge between the elite revolutionary leadership still

266
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,680
based in the capital cities and the mass of peasants.

267
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,140
They hoped one day to organize and lead.

268
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:55,270
The other group that this elite revolutionary leadership realized had potential was that

269
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,000
semi seasonal labor force that moved back and forth between industrial labor sites like

270
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,870
factories and mines and railroad projects and their home villages.

271
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,930
If you were a socialist revolutionary organizer, you could maneuver your way into one of

272
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,740
these mass concentrations of industrial workers that we talked about at the end of

273
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:20,530
episode ten point eighteen on the Vita system and find a very receptive audience, an

274
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,280
audience whose minds had been opened by the general terribleness of their working

275
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,320
conditions. Then you could explain to them your theory of what socialist revolution would

276
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,010
look like, and they would carry that message back to their friends and families in the

277
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,020
home villages. Ideas that were now being delivered not by strangers who just showed up

278
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,850
one day and started saying, Hey, you know what?

279
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,960
Down with the czar.

280
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,280
They heard it from their cousin or their sister or their best friend.

281
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,560
And with a little luck, when those workers then returned to their factories, the people

282
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,820
left behind might find a radical member of the rural intelligentsia lurking around, ready

283
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,710
to talk more about all of these interesting new ideas and further foster revolutionary

284
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:05,640
consciousness. So this was a pretty exciting realization and it made the Southern groups

285
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:10,050
more convinced that right now, today, they should think of the peasants as a force that

286
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:16,120
could be mobilized. Now, as I've said, these groups are not very big and they would still

287
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,310
have to be based in the cities, focused mostly on the urban workers, but they could

288
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,100
create a social web that would spread ideas.

289
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,530
And when the time was right, a revolutionary army could come marching out of the rural

290
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:35,220
countryside. This wasn't going to happen overnight, but the path was clear and the heart

291
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,330
of what is going to become socialist revolutionary ideology started beating.

292
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:47,190
The third pillar of the future is ours grew out of a worker education circle in Minsk

293
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,170
that was dubbed the Workers Party or the political emancipation of Russia.

294
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,400
Founded in 1895, the Workers Party for the political emancipation of Russia was unique in

295
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,230
that it was specifically focused on the Jewish community, a community that held its own

296
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,660
unique position inside the Russian empire.

297
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,640
Navigating as they did between the anti-Semitic assumptions of the czarist authorities,

298
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,530
that the Jews did not really fit into a system of orthodoxy, autocracy and nationality

299
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,330
and the anti-Semitic assumptions of many revolutionary Marxists and populists and

300
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,460
anarchists that the Jews were greedy parasites, adversaries, not allies.

301
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,780
In the coming revolution.

302
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,570
But that said, this Jewish centered Workers Party operated a lot like the Northern Union

303
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,440
did in the tradition of terroristic narrowed as a man orgasm.

304
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,690
They believed that first and foremost, the revolutionary task was to overthrow the Tsar.

305
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,580
What better way to fight the encroaching tyranny of capitalism than overthrowing the

306
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,860
state which backed up those capitalists with the force of the police and the army and an

307
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,690
array of anti-labor laws?

308
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,600
So the Workers Party for the political emancipation of Russia and the Northern Union were

309
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,070
largely in agreement about both the task and the methods of revolution.

310
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,380
One of the key organizers of the Workers Party was an old veteran of the 1870s who was

311
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,490
among those leaders now returning from a long period of political exile.

312
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,830
They had in fact, spent the last 20 years bouncing around between prisons, penal labor

313
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,750
camps and supervised exile.

314
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:32,440
I'm speaking of Yekaterina Bresch, cofs Gaia, a revolutionary stalwart on her way to

315
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,410
earning the nickname Babushka, the grandmother.

316
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:44,000
Born in 1844, into a well-to-do land and serf owning family purse, coskata was 17 years

317
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,180
old when the Emancipation Decree was issued in 1861.

318
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,040
She enthusiastically helped her father navigate the logistics of freeing the family's

319
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,510
serfs and took it upon herself to organize education and literacy programs.

320
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,060
Two years later, she followed a normal social path by marrying a landowning magistrate.

321
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,300
But that was a very short lived experiment with normalcy.

322
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,920
She left her husband two years later and moved to Kiev with her sister and a friend named

323
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,000
Maria called akina.

324
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,940
Upon arrival, the three of them set up house and got super into Bakunin ist anarchism

325
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,080
meeting at this point. A young 20 year old name, Pavel Axlerod.

326
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,750
Now, her sister appears to have died young, but in 1874, Prescotts, Gaia and Maria called

327
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,120
akina, of course, went to the people.

328
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,900
They were, however, soon tipped off that they might be arrested and called.

329
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,980
Akino went home.

330
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,820
But Bresch cofs Gaia simply bounced to other villages.

331
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,650
Eventually, though, she was arrested while trying to pass a checkpoint dressed as a

332
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,930
peasant. She failed to act the part and show the instinctive deference expected from a

333
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,710
peasant woman. She blew her own cover and was arrested.

334
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,800
So now she's in jail.

335
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:02,350
And then she wound up as one of the 193 in the famous trial of the hundred and ninety

336
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:07,060
three, when it was her turn to stand a queue, she gave a defiant speech declaring that

337
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,960
she did not recognize the court's authority over her and that, yes, she was a socialist

338
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,870
and that, yes, she was a revolutionary and she was damn proud of it.

339
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,670
The court, of course, recognized its own authority over her and unlike most other

340
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,100
arrested women who were acquitted and set free.

341
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:27,560
BISKUPSKI I was given five years penal labor in Siberia and I have seen it claimed that

342
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,970
she was the first woman in Russia sentenced to prison labor for political crimes.

343
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,880
And now I must break this story so that we can tie ourselves back to some big drama from

344
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,700
previous episodes because after the sentencing, Bresch coughs, his old friend Maria

345
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:49,580
called akina resolved on a plan to murder the prosecutor in revenge, and Maria got

346
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,150
together with one of her new friends to plot a double assassination.

347
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,390
And that new friend was Veera ZATZ sulik.

348
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,230
So, yes, when I talked about Zeze Xu Lynches Conrad in the murder conspiracy that was

349
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,340
Maria killed akina. This is a very small world we're talking about here.

350
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,010
Anyway, Welles sulik was able to get her shot off called akina was not, and instead she

351
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,790
was arrested and sentenced herself to 10 years in Siberia.

352
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,700
But getting back to brush costs scam after a couple years, her sentence was reduced from

353
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,890
penal labor to mere exile and she immediately attempted to flee the country.

354
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,970
But the attempt failed and so she got four more years hard labor.

355
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,680
After completing that sentence, she was back to living in mere exile again.

356
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,930
When an American journalist came through in 1885 and Bresch cost, Gaia gave an interview

357
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,840
where she said that maybe she would die in exile.

358
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,370
Maybe here children would die in exile, maybe her grandchildren would die in exile.

359
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,350
But someday it would all be worth it.

360
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,880
This interview made her a minor celebrity among unionists and radicals and progressive

361
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,560
liberals in the English speaking world.

362
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,500
Though, as it turned out, neither she nor her children nor her grandchildren died in

363
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,440
exile in 1896, she was released as part of a general amnesty that accompanied the formal

364
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,540
coronation of Nicholas.

365
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,640
The second now well past 50 years old.

366
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,220
She returned home so full of thankfulness at the amnesty that she went right back to

367
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,990
organizing for a socialist revolution.

368
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,000
This time in Minsk.

369
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,900
Her partner in crime during this period was future inner circle as our leader, Gregory

370
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:37,450
Yasuni. You're Sunni, was 25 years younger than Breast scoffs Gaia, but they formed a

371
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,700
working revolutionary partnership with Bresch cofs Gaia.

372
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,700
As the dynamic, charismatic, passionate, living witness to the indomitable spirit of

373
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,810
revolutionary will.

374
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,210
Then once the audience was fired up, Gear Chinny would follow in her wake and handle the

375
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,800
practical logistics of organizing and establishing groups and communication between them.

376
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,110
Their partnership made the Workers Party for the Political Emancipation of Russia one of

377
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,320
the most dedicated and well organized inside Russia.

378
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,370
And though even at its peak, there were never more than 60 full time members.

379
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,940
They would be one of the backbones of the coming S.R.

380
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:21,730
coalition. The fourth and final group we need to talk about today are those not in Russia

381
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,650
at all, because if you had been in people's will when the reactionary hammer came down in

382
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:32,980
1881 and you managed to escape arrest and execution or exile, you invariably wound up

383
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,800
fleeing abroad and settling in Russian emigre enclaves, usually in Switzerland or Paris

384
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:44,710
or London. As so often happens with communities of exiled radicals, as we've seen going

385
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:50,370
all the way back to the post 1848 emigre waters that marks and angles and Bakunin swam in

386
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,650
these exile groups, continued to publish pamphlets and newspapers that focused as much on

387
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,800
prosecuting beefs and rivalries amongst themselves.

388
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,410
As the larger project of socialist revolution, everyone was pushing their own

389
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,990
idiosyncratic vision for the revolutionary future.

390
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,920
Even as that revolutionary future seemed further away than ever.

391
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:18,000
The most important of these groups came together in Paris, where one of the old deans of

392
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,040
Russian populism, Pyotr Lavrov, had moved after his time in Switzerland.

393
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:29,190
Lavrov, remember, had been an influential Neruda's theorist going all the way back before

394
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:35,900
the going to the people, and he was as old an old timer as they came in the mid 1890s.

395
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,050
He was enjoying something of a personal renaissance after the failure of people's will

396
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:46,920
style. Quick terrorism made Lavrov pitch for slow and steady education seemed much wiser

397
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,850
in retrospect. So in the early 1890s, Lavrov and a few other old exiled luminaries formed

398
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,080
their own group of veterans.

399
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:00,820
Now that conditions in Russia seem to be improving, they hope to form a kind of Neruda's

400
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,550
senior leadership in exile who could observe and direct their younger comrades who were

401
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,170
making good headway back home.

402
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,610
But though their voices were listened to and their service was respected, they suffered

403
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,990
from the same delusion that many emigrate groups abroad suffer in all times in places,

404
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,720
namely that while they consider themselves to be the leaders of the movement, the people

405
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,980
on the ground back home didn't know them and certainly weren't going to take orders from

406
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,580
them. The leaders in Russia saw themselves as the leaders, and they saw the emigres

407
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,420
serving merely as ambassadors and fundraisers, not as like the Central Committee of the

408
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:45,170
revolution. This disconnect is shown clearly in that one of the principal preoccupations

409
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,060
of those leaders inside Russia was how to get their own printing presses and newspapers

410
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:55,340
going because the literature being smuggled in from abroad was so thoroughly out of touch

411
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,660
and disconnected from realities in Russia, it was just all around unhelpful.

412
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,590
So the emigres are going to form the fourth group, the fourth pillar of what becomes the

413
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:13,920
Assads. And by the late 1890s, our future socialist revolutionaries are coming back to

414
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,460
life like buddying little schuetze after a long winter.

415
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,240
But as they came back to life, they would find themselves in direct competition with a

416
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,220
new species of revolutionary that they had not had to contend with back in the 1870s.

417
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,950
And that was Marxist Social Democrats.

418
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:37,740
And next week will be a very important episode in the Revolutions podcast, because we

419
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,020
will be introducing two of the most important members of the energetic younger generation

420
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,370
of Russian Marxists.

421
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:51,510
So join me next week when I finally introduce you to Lenin and Crips Ghayad.
