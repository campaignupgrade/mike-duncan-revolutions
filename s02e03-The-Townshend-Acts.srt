00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,380
Hello and welcome to revolutions.

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,010
Episode 19, The Townsend Acts.

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,410
So we ended last time with the demise of the Stamp Act, which had done so little to raise

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,260
revenue, so much to infuriate the colonies.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,870
But the British government's pullback from the Stamp Act had been a retreat, not a

6
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,140
surrender. And this week we will walk through their second attempt to raise money from

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,020
the colonies. Before we get going, though, I should also probably point out that my dream

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,280
of succinctly moving through the pre-revolutionary period in two episodes was, of course,

9
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,910
pure folly and I've expanded it out to three.

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,010
So last time was the Stamp Act.

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,340
This week will be the Townsend Axe.

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,620
Next week will be the Tea Act, which works better from a narrative perspective anyway.

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,550
OK, so by the spring of 1766, the Stamp Act has been repealed and the Declaratory Act

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,140
passed, this formula for ending the crisis worked well for the moment.

15
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,350
But Lord Rockingham did not long survive the solution.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,230
And in July, he was dismissed as prime minister in his place.

17
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,090
George the third, turned to the man who had successfully steered Britain to victory

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,410
during the Seven Years War.

19
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,480
William Pitt, the elder.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,630
This was good news for the colonies as Pitt had just come out as a full throated

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,190
supporter of American interests.

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,910
But while it looked good on paper, the reality left much to be desired in accepting the

23
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,130
prime ministership. Pitt was also created First Earl of Chatham, taking him out of the

24
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,840
House of Commons and plopping him into the House of Lords, where his ability to manage

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,240
daily administration was much reduced.

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,040
Not that it mattered anyway.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,740
It was in poor health and frequently absent from London altogether, without a strong

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,340
guiding hand. The individual ministers were left to their own devices.

29
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,430
Even those devices ran contrary to Pit's wishes, as was the case with the new Chancellor

30
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,530
of the Exchequer, Charles Townsend.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,150
The 41 year old Townsend was famously as sharp of tongue as he was of mind, and he had a

32
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,460
reputation for political unpredictability.

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,840
But he does seem to have consistently believed that there was money to be had in the

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,930
colonies and parliament had every right to get at it.

35
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,570
So he started drawing up a colonial revenue scheme that would cleverly skirt the American

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,790
objection to so-called direct taxes.

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,890
This put him on the wrong side of Pitt, who attempted to oust Townsend from the ministry.

38
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,940
But before he could finish the job, Pitt suffered a physical collapse that knocked him

39
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,890
out of commission. This left Townsend the dominant personality in an otherwise weak

40
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,520
ministry, and he energetically pushed his plans through parliament.

41
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,910
The result was the passage in June 1767 of the so-called Towns and Acts.

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,540
The towns an axe actually refer to five inter-related bills, including one designed to

43
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,860
help shore up the floundering East India Company and one specifically targeting the New

44
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,850
York Assembly for their failure to comply with the Quartering Act of 1765.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,220
But when most people talk about the towns and acts they are generally referring to is the

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,900
most explosive component.

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:29,190
The Revenue Act, which levied import duties on lead glass, paper, printer ink and t

48
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,470
exactly the kind of trade base taxes the colonists themselves had just said parliament

49
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,520
was allowed to levy to ensure compliance with the new duties.

50
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,740
The Towns and Acts also created a board of Customs, which meant that even more salary

51
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,800
agents would soon be digging around in colonial business.

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,330
But on top of these two innovations, which we're sure all on their own to rile up the

53
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,110
colonists, Townsend inserted another innovation into this program.

54
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,420
Revenue from the duties would be used to pay the salaries of colonial governors.

55
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,390
Up until this point, governors had been paid by grants from the colonial assemblies.

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,880
This power of the purse had done much to ensure that the governors never drifted too far

57
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,520
out of line. Removing this all important check sent the colonial warning bells back to

58
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,020
clanging as it appeared to be striking right at the heart of self-government.

59
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,520
In response to the Townsend Axe and one of the most influential series of articles of the

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,280
whole revolutionary era started circulating the colonies in the summer of 1767, the

61
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,010
letters from a Pennsylvania farmer written by John Dickinson, who was no farmer but

62
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,960
rather a successful Philadelphia lawyer.

63
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,120
The letters eloquently furthered the argument that Parliament did not have the right to

64
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,710
tax the colonies for revenue under any circumstances, and that whatever pretences to the

65
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,330
contrary, the Townsend duties were clearly designed to generate revenue, not regulate

66
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,460
trade. The letters were important because initially reaction to the Townsend Act was

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,260
muted. In many cases, the colonists were exhausted from the recent battle over the Stamp

68
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,730
Act, and they weren't super stoked about having to immediately remobilize for war.

69
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,930
But when Dickinson's letters started showing up throughout the colonies, they

70
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,050
persuasively confirm the necessity of further resistance.

71
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,860
But Dickinson himself was no radical, and he advocated frugality, home manufacturing and

72
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,080
petitioning as the surest means to avoid falling for Parliament unconstitutional taxes.

73
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,630
It was left to more radical leaders to push the envelope in the great defence of American

74
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:43,240
liberty. Charles Townsend himself, though, would not live to see that great defense as he

75
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,920
died suddenly in September.

76
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:52,000
1767, his death and the continued incapacitation of Pitt, the elder left the ministry

77
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,230
basically rudderless and it fell to the 33 year old Duke of Grafton.

78
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,030
First Lord of the Treasury to try to lead the way, though he would not be recognized as

79
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,950
prime minister until Pitt finally resigned in October 1768.

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,130
But don't worry. The Duke of Grafton is not on the test.

81
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,240
When the new customs official started arriving in the colonies in November, the radical

82
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,470
leaders in Boston tried to get the rest of Massachusetts to stop buying British goods,

83
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,060
but they got nowhere because for the moment, everyone just wanted things to go back to

84
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,750
normal. But by February 1768, a Samuel Adams had called in every favor he could in the

85
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,730
Massachusetts assembly to get them to produce another circular letter like the one that

86
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,170
had gone out over the Stamp Act.

87
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,660
Though this letter was milder and merely called for the other colonies to harmonize a

88
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,670
response to the towns acts, it did contain the more extreme assertion that the colonists

89
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,920
weren't simply unrepresented in parliament.

90
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,510
They could never be represented in parliament because they were, quote, separated by an

91
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,220
ocean of a thousand leagues.

92
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,100
So in other words, don't expect to ever byas off with like 13 seats in parliament.

93
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,610
The new circular letter was, of course, authored personally by Samuel Adams, who I

94
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,290
briefly introduced last time, but since he's so central to the revolutionary movement, we

95
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,720
do need to flesh him out of it.

96
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,600
Born in Boston in 1722 to a prosperous merchant, young Sam entered Harvard and 1736 and

97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,400
was headed for a career in the church.

98
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,940
But then politics caught his eye and he never looked back.

99
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,160
Among all the founding fathers, there was probably no one so singularly focused on

100
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,250
politics at the expense of every other aspect of his life.

101
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,160
As Samuel Adams, it was his consuming passion.

102
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,370
He went into business after graduation, but had neither the head nor the heart for it.

103
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,390
And he lost all the money his father loaned him to get started.

104
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,050
His love of politics, though, led him to various public offices in Boston, where he soon

105
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,100
emerged as one of the leaders of the popular faction, that is the group opposed to the

106
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,120
men who circled around the royal governor after the French and Indian War.

107
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,110
Adams became a leader in the fight against British taxation, fiercely denouncing, in turn

108
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,610
the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act.

109
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,200
Though exactly how involved he was in the Stamp Act riots is still an open question.

110
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,120
Not that he didn't approve of them, just that he probably wasn't the arch puppet master

111
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,130
his enemies often made him out to be.

112
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,780
When the Townsend acts came around, Adams was obviously fired up.

113
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,290
But as I've mentioned, public opinion was running conservative these days.

114
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,390
But then Adams and his friends got a timely assist from the new costume's commissioners,

115
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,800
who were even more committed to their jobs than the inspectors who had been sent over to

116
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,850
enforce the Sugar Act.

117
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:45,150
These new customs agents saw it as their job not to simply collect taxes, but also to

118
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,850
reinforce political obedience, which predictably provoked political disobedience.

119
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,070
One of the first things they decided to do was to make an example of leading Boston

120
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,280
merchant and occasional Boston smuggler John Handcock, who we also now have to stop and

121
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,770
take a look at. Fifteen years younger than his political mentor, Samuel Adams.

122
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,830
John Hancock was born in Braintree in 1737, making him just 31 years old at the time of

123
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,030
the town's in crisis.

124
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,480
After graduating from Harvard and 1754, he went to work in his uncle's import export

125
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,410
house, where he made a good living on government contracts during the French and Indian

126
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,770
War. And he started to appreciate the finer things in life.

127
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,020
After a short stint living in London to work the other side of the business, Handcock

128
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,520
returned to Boston and inherited everything when his uncle died in 1764.

129
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,560
But as successful as he was business wise.

130
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,340
Handcock was mostly obsessed with politics, and he soon fell under the sway of Adams, who

131
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,990
guided the young man's ambitions or, if you prefer, the arch puppet master version of

132
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,270
history. The Machiavellian Adams manipulated the rich and gullible Handcock into doing

133
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:04,300
his bidding. Hancock's wealth and radical politics made him an obvious target for the new

134
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,470
Board of Customs. Who knew that, like most Boston merchants, Handcock had learned the

135
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,990
fine art of mixing declared cargo with undeclared cargo with Miss declared cargo.

136
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,920
So it shouldn't be too hard to catch him in the act of something.

137
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,780
The customs officials made two moves against Handcock in the spring and summer of 1768,

138
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,400
the first of which backfired.

139
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,800
The second of which backfired spectacularly.

140
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,800
In March, an agent boarded one of Handcock ships, finding nothing illegal.

141
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,970
He headed down below decks where his authority did not extend.

142
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,470
This affront was all the more galling because he didn't even have a writ of assistance.

143
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,760
Essentially a blanket search warrant tool that was so despised it would soon be

144
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,410
prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.

145
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,160
The agent was forcibly thrown off the ship for trespassing.

146
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,510
The local court upheld Hancox right not to be searched illegally.

147
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,820
This was the move that backfired.

148
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,490
The move backfired spectacularly.

149
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,380
Came in May when the Board of Customs seized one of Handcock shipped aptly named the

150
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,960
Liberty and held it on a legal technicality.

151
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,300
This was too much for the rejuvenated Boston radicals when the Navy attempted to move the

152
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,010
ship in June. A mob convened on the dock and successfully prevented the ship from being

153
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,870
taken away when the customs agents filed their reports back home.

154
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,400
They described the mob as a bunch of out-of-control barbarians, begged the ministry to

155
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,140
send troops to help restore order.

156
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:37,530
But it was clear from other eyewitnesses that, like the Stamp Act riots of 1765, the mob

157
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,030
was disciplined and under control, which to a guy like, say, Lt.

158
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,590
Governor Thomas Hutchinson, was actually scarier because it meant that this was not about

159
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,770
random passion, but highly organized resistance.

160
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,580
By this point, the long distance cross-Atlantic communications had finally gotten around

161
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,140
to providing the governor of Massachusetts, Francis, burnered for the record with an

162
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,430
answer or what to do about the circular letter that had been passed way back in February.

163
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,590
Bernard was ordered to demand the assembly, rescind the letter or be dissolved.

164
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,270
This, of course, is one of the major problems with trying to run a territory when you are

165
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,790
separated by an ocean of a thousand leagues.

166
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,320
When the ministry issued this order, they had no idea that events in Boston had already

167
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,600
progressed to organized mob violence.

168
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,850
But Governor Bernard did.

169
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,290
As he was told, the assembly must rescind the letter or face disillusion.

170
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,820
In the famous vote followed at the end of June, the assembly voted not to rescind by an

171
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,220
overwhelming ninety two to 17, with those ninety two soon being hailed in the streets and

172
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,950
in the press and in the taverns as the glorious ninety-two, the Massachusetts assembly

173
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,360
was immediately dissolved.

174
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,380
Meanwhile, the merchants of the various other colonial ports were starting to have their

175
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,090
reluctance to gear up for war.

176
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,620
Overwhelmed by their annoyance with the new taxes and the new customs officials.

177
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,670
And so they started discussing a new non importation pact.

178
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,890
But every city was worried that if they made the first move, that all their business

179
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,780
would simply move down to the next port.

180
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,460
So non importation could only work if everyone signed on the dotted line.

181
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,070
When the merchants of New York drew up a pact in April, it was contingent on Pennsylvania

182
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,270
signing a similar pact.

183
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,850
The now hugely influential John Dickinson through all his political and rhetorical weight

184
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,260
behind non importation.

185
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,790
But in the end, the more conservative Pennsylvania merchants refused to budge and they

186
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,170
rejected the pact, which meant that New York rejected the pact and then it was back to

187
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,160
square one. On August the 1st, 1768.

188
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,320
However, the merchants of Boston elected to go ahead with unilateral non importation to

189
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,510
commence January, the first event since the last meeting in April, convinced New York to

190
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,970
soon follow suit. Pennsylvania continued to drag their feet, but in the end, the main

191
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,650
threat of non importation was not the conservatives in Philadelphia who did get on board

192
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,040
in March 1769.

193
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,580
But the loose cannons over in Rhode Island, the Rhode Island merchants took a look around

194
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,230
at the closed for business signs going up and said, well, boys, if we stay open, we are

195
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,030
going to make a killing as well.

196
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,920
They did until Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania shut up their docks, not just to

197
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,130
imports from Britain, but also anything coming out of Rhode Island.

198
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,720
Ever the pragmatist, the Rhode Islanders drafted a non importation pact of their own,

199
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,130
which was just tight enough to satisfy their neighbors, but not so tight that they didn't

200
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,940
continue to bring in a few odds and ends spurned by the other colonies.

201
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,430
But by then, of course, things had gone from bad to worse.

202
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,880
Up in Boston. Finally, reacting to the Liberty incident, the ministry ordered 4000 troops

203
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,720
down from Halifax in September to help bring the rabble to heel.

204
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,980
Reckoning the probably the worst thing that could happen would be for these troops to

205
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,880
show up unannounced. Governor Bernard leaked word of their pending arrival.

206
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,620
The leaders of Massachusetts then demanded that their assembly be allowed to reconvene so

207
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,790
they could discuss a response.

208
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,470
But Bernard refused.

209
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,230
So on September the 22nd, an unofficial convention of towns met in Boston to urge the

210
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,460
governor to reconsider.

211
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:23,220
The meeting wasn't technically illegal, but was yet another sign that the colonists were

212
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,960
all too willing to defy their supposed masters and take matters into their own hands.

213
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,400
About a week later, the ships carrying the troops arrived in Boston, and on October the

214
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,660
1st, 1768, soldiers began to disembark from the hysterical letters coming from the

215
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,710
customs agents. These soldiers probably expected to walk into something out of Lord of

216
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,330
the Flies, but instead they found a peaceful city going about its business.

217
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,610
The radical leaders recognizing that 4000 armed regulars is not something you actively

218
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:01,250
resist. But the decision not to engage in any overt resistance did not mean that there

219
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,750
would be no resistance at all.

220
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,240
As the troops discovered, when they found no available lodgings, they were forced to set

221
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,010
up a tent camp on the Commons.

222
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,230
It would take weeks of threats, wrangling and confrontations before the troops were able

223
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,320
to move into passable winter quarters in leased warehouses.

224
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,280
So the city may have been peaceful, but it was not subdued.

225
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:31,380
The whole of 1769 was defined by rising tensions in occupied Boston, soldiers and

226
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,160
civilians were constantly at odds and constantly in each other's faces.

227
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,950
Boston was a big city for colonial North America, but it wasn't a big city.

228
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,440
And the two sides fell into what Robert Middle Koff describes as familiar mutual

229
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,740
contempt.. The soldiers had a tendency, as all soldiers do, to get drunk, break the

230
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,600
Sabbath. Then how shall I put this seduce away the virtue of the local maidens.

231
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,330
On top of that, off duty enlisted men were only too happy to do manual labor to

232
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,770
supplement their meager pay.

233
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,540
Taking jobs away from the unskilled workers who form the rank and file of the Boston

234
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:16,790
mobs. All through 1769, these two sides butted heads, insulting each other and a few

235
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,840
fistfights broke out.

236
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:22,430
Any one of these incidents threatened to blow the lid off the pressure cooker.

237
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,590
By August, Governor Burnered had had enough.

238
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,460
And after nine years as governor, decided that, however this was going to be resolved, he

239
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,570
was washing his hands of it.

240
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,150
He sailed back to England and the old scourge of the populace, Thomas Hutchinson became

241
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:43,380
acting governor. Meanwhile, in the rest of the colony, 1769 saw the continued expansion

242
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,030
of the non importation movement.

243
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,860
The southern colonies first came on board when the Virginia House of Burgesses met in May

244
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,920
and members began denouncing parliamentary taxation.

245
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,230
They were immediately dissolved by the governor.

246
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,250
But undeterred, the Burgesses reconvened unofficially at the Raleigh Tavern.

247
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,040
There they debated and then adopted the Virginia Association Non Importation Agreement.

248
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,180
It was not quite as strict as those being passed up in the north, but one that would do

249
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:15,390
the job. The Virginia Association also marks the first foray into radical politics for

250
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,860
the wealthy Virginia planter George Washington, who, along with his friend and neighbor

251
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,210
George Mason, helped convince their fellow Burgess's to join the association.

252
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,960
I'll have more to say about both of these guys down the road, especially obviously George

253
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,250
Washington, but I think I'll wait to take stock of the indispensable man of the

254
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,360
revolution when he comes striding into the second Continental Congress wearing a full

255
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,880
dress uniform. It's more dramatic that way.

256
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,100
After Virginia non importation passed, the rest of the South followed at a rate of about

257
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,820
a colony a month, which isn't to say that they needed Virginia to lead the way.

258
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,950
Just that that's the way it happened to go.

259
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,040
By the end of the year, the American colonies formed a solid wall, orders to British

260
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,330
merchant houses, dried-up ships carrying targeted goods were turned away.

261
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,340
It had taken a little while longer, but the towns and acts like the Stamp Act was

262
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,770
officially becoming more trouble than it was worth.

263
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,600
Unfortunately, things would get worse before they would get better, though, as we will

264
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,920
see next week, things will get better, at least for a little while.

265
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,950
Back in Britain, King George finally relieved the young Duke of Grafton of the burden he

266
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,290
had proved himself incapable of bearing any reform, the ministry yet again, this time

267
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,520
turning to Lord North.

268
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,240
In January 1770, North had been serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer since Townsend

269
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,610
death, and he was able to step seamlessly into his new role.

270
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,510
Luckily for all of you out there, Lord North is going to stick around for a while.

271
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,350
All the way through the Revolutionary War, in fact, so we can finally dispense with this

272
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,610
revolving door of British prime ministers that define the 1760s.

273
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,980
As Lord North took office, Massachusetts was rapidly heading towards one of the most

274
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,870
famous set pieces of the revolution.

275
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,670
The Boston Massacre.

276
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,830
The groundwork was laid in February by an ugly incident involving a merchant accused of

277
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,120
breaking the non importation agreement that ended with an 11 year old kid getting shot

278
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,540
and killed, thousands turned out for a funeral procession.

279
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,960
It was as much a show political force as memorial to the boy.

280
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,220
This was followed by a few weeks of escalating anger and recurrent fights between

281
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,120
soldiers and civilians who were utterly sick of the sight of the other.

282
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,420
Finally, on March the 5th, 1770, it all came to a head.

283
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,880
Outside the Customs House on Kingstree, Private Hugh White was chatting with some off

284
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,110
duty comrades when a passing Bostonian made a crack about their commanding officer.

285
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,040
Private White proceeded to clock the dude upside the head.

286
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,040
The off duty soldiers made themselves scarce, leaving Private White to deal with the ring

287
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,930
of ticked off Bostonians who soon surrounded him, White backed up against the Customs

288
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:08,060
House door, gun drawn, the growing crowd heckled them and dared him to shoot.

289
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,140
Up the street. Captain Preston, commander of the Customs House Garrison.

290
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,890
Watch this all unfold.

291
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,340
He was probably hoping it would just resolve itself naturally.

292
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,140
But then the church bells started going off and more men, these armed with clubs, et

293
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,090
cetera, started showing up.

294
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,450
And Captain Preston decided it was high time to go get his man.

295
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,070
He led a corporal and six privates through the crowd, now numbering some three or four

296
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,560
hundred, but rather than just pulling private white out of there.

297
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,000
Preston had his men form a semicircle facing the crowd.

298
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,460
Guns unfortunately loaded.

299
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,610
A tense 15 minute standoff ensued with the civilians, insulting the soldiers and pelting

300
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,500
them with snowballs and chunks of ice.

301
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,010
One of those snowballs finally hit a private at the end of the line.

302
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,920
He fell down probably after slipping on the ice.

303
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,410
And when he popped back up, he fired his gun.

304
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,280
Now reports conflict about how long of a pause followed the first shot.

305
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,450
But however long it was, the jumpy soldiers were soon firing into the crowd.

306
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,220
Eleven men were hit.

307
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,110
Five ultimately died.

308
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,940
Six more were just wounded.

309
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,590
A regimens worth of British regulars were soon on hand to secure the peace.

310
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,690
But though the crowd fell back, it continued to grow and was only dispersed when Acting

311
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,510
Governor Hutchinson promised a full inquiry.

312
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,160
The next morning, captain pressed into his men, were arrested by the local authorities.

313
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:38,330
In the months that followed, a ruckus wore in the press erupted as radicals and

314
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,460
conservatives tried to control the story.

315
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,920
Are we talking about innocent boys gunned down by the cruel lobster backs or brave

316
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,770
soldiers defending themselves against violent hooligans?

317
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,290
It was in these months that silversmith Paul Revere produced his famous plate depicting

318
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,100
Preston ordering a line of disciplined troops to fire on an unarmed crowd.

319
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,840
Threw a good shot of it up at Revolution's podcast on com if you want to check it out.

320
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,030
But as the two sides fought over the meaning of the incident, the radical leadership took

321
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:13,220
pains to ensure that the soldiers received a fair trial as moderates might be alienated

322
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,720
by summary mob justice.

323
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,300
Which brings us to the man they turned to to defend the soldiers and make sure that they

324
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,460
were zealously and honestly defended.

325
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,270
Thirty five year old attorney John Adams.

326
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,440
John Adams was born in Braintree in 1735.

327
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,590
His father was a farmer and a church deacon, and his mother came from the influential

328
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,510
Boylston family. The age of 16, he went off to Harvard after graduation.

329
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,010
He spent a few years teaching in Worcester, dashing his father's hopes that he would

330
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,390
become a minister. Adams became enchanted with the law.

331
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,900
Apprenticing in a Worcester law office and then earning a master's degree at Harvard in

332
00:23:53,900 --> 00:24:02,130
1758. After a few years of bachelor lawyering, Adams married Abigail Smith in 1764,

333
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,450
creating one of the all time great husband and wife teams in American history.

334
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,290
Adams made his first entry into public life.

335
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,500
The next year as a staunch opponent of the Stamp Act.

336
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:18,360
And though he was an early and committed advocate of American rights, he was

337
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,130
constitutionally allergic to the kind of radical populism spouse by his second cousin,

338
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:31,970
Samuel. The short and punchy Adams was famously argumentative, irascible and vain, but he

339
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:38,240
was also brilliant and passionate and irresistible at once on aspiring and the subject of

340
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:44,120
endless ridicule. And he will soon become known as both the Colossus of Independence and

341
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:50,960
his rotund Eddie Adams took on the Boston Massacre case with some hesitation.

342
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,930
He was, after all, an ambitious man with patriot leanings.

343
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,700
But in the end, he believed that the men deserve their day in court, and that facts, not

344
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,670
emotion, deserve to carry the day.

345
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,630
After Captain Preston was tried and acquitted separately in October, it was proven beyond

346
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,760
any doubt that he never ordered his men to fire.

347
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,180
The rest of the soldiers were brought up for murder in November.

348
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,440
Adams, of course, did more than put on a good show.

349
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,690
He slaughtered the prosecution.

350
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,430
He argued that if the soldiers were endangered by the mob, then they had every right to

351
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:27,350
fire. And if they weren't technically endangered, but had been provoked by the mob, then

352
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,850
the most they could be convicted of with manslaughter, not murder, as all the evidence

353
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,910
suggested that the mob was not a bunch of innocent bystanders.

354
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,450
The jury agreed with Adams after just a few hours deliberation.

355
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,310
Six of the soldiers were acquitted outright, while the other two were convicted of

356
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:48,230
manslaughter. These two, however, were soon released with a reduced sentence of public

357
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:55,730
branding. Now, surprisingly, the acquittals did not like ignite a riot, though the Boston

358
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:01,100
massacre continued to be played up and commemorated annually by now, some of the spark

359
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,670
had gone out of the radical course.

360
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:08,180
Mostly this was because soon after the incident itself, parliament once again caved to

361
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,430
the wall of colonial opposition and repealed the Townsend duties in April 1770.

362
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,430
Well, not all the towns duties as with the Stamp Act repeal parliament couldn't walk away

363
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:24,560
without leaving its foot in the door on the duty on tea was kept in place too

364
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,630
insignificant to provoke mass resistance.

365
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,220
But more than enough to keep the precedent going that Parliament had the right to impose

366
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,190
whatever taxes it wished when ever it wished.

367
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,470
Next week, we'll begin with two years of relative calm, which everyone hope meant that

368
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,670
the crisis was now over.

369
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,140
But in 1773, Parliament will reignite the Patriot flame when they attempt to bail out the

370
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:57,300
totally mismanaged East India Company by allowing them to import tea directly into the

371
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,500
colonies, bypassing the colonial merchants who made their living as middlemen.

372
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,330
As you can imagine, the merchants were not too happy about this and they were led down

373
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,080
the path. The next great set piece of the revolution, the Boston Tea Party.
