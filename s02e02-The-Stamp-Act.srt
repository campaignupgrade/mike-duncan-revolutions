1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,300
Hello and welcome to revolutions.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,820
Episode 18, The Stamp Act.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,430
As I said at the end of last week's show, the story of the American Revolution begins

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,940
with the end of the French and Indian War in 1763.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,300
Now, that does not mean that it was all downhill from there.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,170
And there were a number of different points along the way that everyone could have safely

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,910
peeled off. But in the end, it was British imperial policy after the war and the

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,410
escalating cycles of American resistance they provoked that were the ground from which

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,580
the revolution sprang.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,070
So though nothing is inevitable.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,210
The road to independence clearly begins in 1763.

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,420
Now, one thing I'll add before we move on is that any truly comprehensive account of the

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,550
American Revolution would require 13 different chapters for every major turning point in

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,300
history, from the Sugar Act to the ratification of the Constitution.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,660
Because local concerns, interests and personalities unique to each colony defined how

16
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,160
those turning points unfolded.

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,240
But unfortunately, we don't really have the time to provide that kind of

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,410
comprehensiveness. So for the most part, we'll be following the leading edge of

19
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,480
radicalism or the most influential supporters of that radicalism, which means that we'll

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,550
be talking an awful lot about events in Massachusetts and Virginia and Pennsylvania and

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,120
much less about Connecticut and Delaware and North Carolina.

22
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,820
But let me state unequivocally that the revolution was provoked, debated and waged in

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,230
every colony. And I would hate for anyone to walk away thinking that my silence on, let's

24
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,620
say, events in Maryland means that nothing was going on in Maryland.

25
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,940
Things were going on in Maryland.

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,860
Things were going on all over the place.

27
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,500
But we have to pick and choose our battles.

28
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,470
Now, as I mentioned last week, one of the central features of American colonial life

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,210
before 1763 was that British administration was pretty hands off.

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,730
There is a great paragraph from Edmund Morgan's birth of the Republic that not only makes

31
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,780
this point, but also provides a succinct description of the colonial administrative

32
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,330
framework. So I'm just going to copy and paste it.

33
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,390
Administration of the Colonies was left to the king, who turned it over to his secretary

34
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,380
of State for Southern Affairs, whose principal business was England's relations with

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,000
Southern Europe. The secretary left it pretty much to the Board of Trade and Plantations,

36
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,450
a sort of chamber of commerce with purely advisory powers.

37
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,300
The Board of Trade told the secretary what to do.

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,040
He told the royal governors.

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,120
The governors told the colonists and the colonists did what they pleased.

40
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,910
The point here is that whatever direct control the British ministry had tried to wield in

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,130
the colonies was usually stymied by the skimpy imperial apparatus actually on the scene

42
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,360
in North America. That is what they are about to try to change.

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,020
To further unpack Morgan's quote, though, I should probably mention that by the king, we

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,060
are now talking about 25 year old George, the third King George had ascended to the

45
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,750
throne in 1760, right in the middle of the war with France.

46
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,110
He was the third Hanoverian king, a dynasty that had been imported from Germany in 1714

47
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,710
after parliament declared that no Roman Catholic could ascend to the throne.

48
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,140
During the first few years of his Randy Young King's ministry was dominated by his old

49
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,850
Scottish tutor, Lord Buit.

50
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,800
But just as the treaty with the French was being signed buit succumb to pressure from

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,350
domestic enemies and retired and George Grenville, first Lord of the Treasury, stepped up

52
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,080
to serve as what we're going to call prime minister.

53
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,760
Even though at this point the term prime minister was merely an unofficial title, and

54
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,740
Grenville himself never used it.

55
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,000
But English historians seem content to recognise the office, starting with Sir Robert

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,740
Walpole back in the seventeen twenties.

57
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,330
And so for convenience sake.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,950
I'm going to use the term to describe the run of prime ministers who will rise and fall

59
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,090
over the next decade as Britain struggles to make sense of its colonial policy.

60
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,520
The problems facing Granville in North America as he took office in April 1763 were

61
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:23,030
threefold. How to ensure the security of Britain's holdings, how to manage and or contain

62
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,780
the colonials hunger for land and then the big one.

63
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,700
How do we pay for everything?

64
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,100
The question of security had been answered by Lord Buit on his way out the door, and it

65
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,780
was decided that a line of forts stretching from Canada to Florida would be permanently

66
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,130
garrisoned by regular troops to defend against possible Spanish encroachment from the

67
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,620
South. Unruly new French Canadian citizens in the North, and American Indians everywhere

68
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,500
in between. Now, this may seem a perfectly reasonable decision, but to the men and women

69
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,450
of the 13 colonies, something rang ominous about it for as long as anyone could remember.

70
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,820
The French had been the main military threat to the colonies, and the ministry had never

71
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,410
seen fit to station a standing army in North America.

72
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,010
But now that that threat has been removed.

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,110
Now you're going to station troops.

74
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,410
The belief that standing armies always wind up being tools of despotism had a long and

75
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,600
rich tradition. So for the colonists, the decision to garrison the Western frontiers set

76
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,130
off an early warning bell.

77
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,280
The question of land hungry colonists was answered in part by the experience the British

78
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,560
had with Pontiac's uprising, a rebellion by a coalition of American Indian tribes that

79
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,750
erupted in May 1763.

80
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,820
Though the uprising ultimately failed, it did convince the ministry that balancing

81
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,290
American Indian interests against American colonial interests would make for sound

82
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,770
policy. So in October, George the third issued the Proclamation Line of 1763, which

83
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,260
basically drew a line along the appellation mountains.

84
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,120
The colonists were to stay east of the line and leave the west, including the much

85
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,580
coveted Ohio Valley to the Indians.

86
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,950
It was a nice idea, but it would turn out to be impossible to enforce in practice and in

87
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,360
the end did little but add to colonial frustrations with the mother country.

88
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,870
The question of money could not, of course, be answered by the colonists alone.

89
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,050
The costs of the recent war had been enormous.

90
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,500
And as First Lord of the Treasury, Grenville woke up every morning staring at one hundred

91
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,540
and twenty two million pounds of debt that had been accumulated by his predecessors.

92
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,670
Grenville made no attempt to try to balance the budget on the backs of the colonists.

93
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,720
Nor did he, even at this point, think about trying to make the colonies fully fund

94
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,010
colonial administration.

95
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,900
But he did think they should chip in, especially now that the permanent troops were going

96
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,490
to need food and supplies.

97
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,190
So as the proclamation line was being issued, Grenville drew up step one of his new

98
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,410
revenue plan, the Sugar Act.

99
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,640
The Sugar Act was not really a bad idea at all.

100
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,220
For years, colonies had dealt with a six penny per gallon tax on foreign molasses by

101
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,420
simply evading it.

102
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,670
The manufacturer of rum was big business in America and British supplies of molasses were

103
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,500
not nearly enough to meet demand.

104
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,080
Meanwhile, the customs agents in charge of enforcing the duty on molasses were underpaid,

105
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,990
unenthusiastic and a long way from home.

106
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,210
So it became standard procedure to give the customs agent a penny and a half per gallon

107
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,160
to look the other way. As foreign molasses was off loaded, Granville's idea was to cut

108
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,470
the molasses duty in half to induce the colonists to return to legal channels and thus

109
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,850
raise more revenue.

110
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,990
The law was passed in April, 1764 by a parliament who had no idea the colonists would

111
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,220
even look sideways at it.

112
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,700
It was, after all, a tax cut, not a tax increase.

113
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,700
Right. But of course, the tax cut was packaged with enforcement mechanisms that no one in

114
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,830
British North America had ever dealt with before.

115
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,830
Corrupt and or absentee customs inspectors were replaced by more diligent agents.

116
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,810
Legal challenges were bumped over to Admiralty courts, which worked on the basis of

117
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,550
guilty until proven innocent.

118
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,690
And naturally, the new law brought with it a mountain of new paperwork.

119
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,940
The Sugar Act also had the misfortune of being launched just as a postwar economic

120
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,400
depression was setting in colonial overseas trade operated to a great extent on the

121
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,320
barter system, leaving rum as one of the few reliable means of actually bringing in the

122
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,600
kind of specie that is hard money that had to circulate to keep the internal colonial

123
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,260
economy functioning and creditors back in England off their backs.

124
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,930
The problem of decreasing money supply was compounded by the Currency Act of September

125
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,720
1764, which ended the practice of individual colonies being able to issue their own paper

126
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,270
money. The Currency Act was driven by British merchants and creditors who worried that

127
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:06,640
colonial paper, subject to no regulation or standardization, would eventually prove

128
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,140
damaging to their investments.

129
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,210
But what it really did was further slow an already sluggish American economy.

130
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,470
In response to the Sugar Act, colonial merchants started getting together, comparing

131
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,390
grievances and sending petitions back to England, asking the ministry to reconsider their

132
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:30,510
decisions. Now, most of these petitions made purely economic arguments, but a few made

133
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,040
the further point that Parliament did not really have the right to tax the colonies

134
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,860
because the colonists were not represented in parliament.

135
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,270
And no Englishman was required to give up his property in voluntarily.

136
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,200
Now, we should pause here a second to consider this idea of property and taxation.

137
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,770
The thing we need to keep in mind is that jealously guarding your property from unjust

138
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,320
taxation was not just about being greedy.

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,420
Well, maybe it was a little bit about being greedy, but mostly it was about the belief

140
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,540
that property represented more than just economic wealth.

141
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,900
It was also the fundamental guarantee of political liberty where property rights existed.

142
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,140
Freedom reigned were property rights did not exist.

143
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,070
Tyranny reigned. This, as you'll recall, was one of the central questions that helped

144
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,570
spark the English civil wars.

145
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,460
Could Charles the first simply assert his right to the property of his subjects without

146
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,290
their consent? The answer turned out to be no.

147
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,580
This was something Englishmen took really, really seriously and the colonists were

148
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,410
nothing if not proud Englishmen.

149
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,020
But once it had been established that only parliament could levy taxes, a hidden question

150
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,850
lingered, a question that went to the heart of the rising tension between the colonists

151
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,340
and the mother country. Did parliamentary control of taxation mean that literally only

152
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,990
parliament could levy taxes?

153
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:01,020
Or was Parliament's control of taxation simply a manifestation of the broader point that

154
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,090
you were only subject to taxes levied by a body within which you are duly represented?

155
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,870
Because it's not like the colonists didn't pay taxes.

156
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,510
They did. But those taxes were levied by the local colonial assembly, which represented

157
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,490
the property interests of each colony.

158
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,780
The problem, of course, is that parliament and the ministry believe that this had been a

159
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,550
practical expedient that had now run its course and it was time for the real authority

160
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,990
parliament to step in.

161
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,610
While the colonies believed that this was all rooted in their long established rights as

162
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,010
Englishmen, the divergence of opinion about who had the right to tax who in the American

163
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,790
colonies would become the central question in the run up to the revolution.

164
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,960
To wit, no taxation without representation.

165
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,340
But if the colonies were hoping for a redress of their grievances in 1765, they were

166
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,290
badly mistaken, also badly mistaken with Granville's ministry, who thought that they

167
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,910
would be able to continue decreeing new taxes without further pushback.

168
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,010
Both sides would be rudely awoken with the arrival of Step 2 in Granville's revenue plan.

169
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,620
The Stamp Act put it simply, the Stamp Act was a tax on paper.

170
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,670
All paper paper used for contracts.

171
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,630
Customs. Receipts. Handbills.

172
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,730
Newspapers. Everything.

173
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,360
This stamped paper would come from England and be distributed in America by a certified

174
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,490
agent. Now, of course, a version of the Stamp Act already existed in Britain, but it was

175
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,710
a novelty in the colonies and one that threatened to worm its way into every aspect of

176
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,350
life. No one would be able to avoid it.

177
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,810
Rumors had been spreading all through 1764 that something like the Stamp Act was on the

178
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:50,150
way. And when word of its passage came in the spring of 1765, the colonists were ready to

179
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,830
fight it tooth and nail.

180
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,350
American indignation over the stamp pack found its first and most eloquent expression in

181
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,060
the Virginia House of Burgesses.

182
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,910
Probably the most August of all the colonial assemblies at the end of May on what

183
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,620
happened to be his twenty ninth birthday.

184
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,240
A young attorney and freshman member of the House named Patrick Henry gave a rather

185
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,590
inflammatory speech asserting that colonial assemblies had the exclusive right of

186
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,630
taxation. Henry finished off this inflammatory speech with the dramatic line.

187
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,890
Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the first.

188
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,480
His Cranwell and George the third.

189
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,610
At which point he was cut off by cries of treason by conservative members who thought

190
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,780
they knew where this was headed.

191
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,860
But the dramatic Henry wryly concluded, George, the third.

192
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,140
May he profit by their example.

193
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,030
He then supposedly wrap this up by saying, if this be treason, make the most of it.

194
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,300
But it is likely that the final bit is apocryphal.

195
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,170
The next day, Henry, an academy of young and more radically inclined Burgess's pushed the

196
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,350
Virginia resolves through a sparsely attended session.

197
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,470
The result were set of five resolutions that stake a defiant colonial position.

198
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,630
They went like this first when the colonists emigrated to America.

199
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,940
They brought with them all their rights as Englishmen.

200
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,000
Second, the Virginia Colonial Charter, granted by King James explicitly stated that

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,430
colonists would be treated as if they lived in England.

202
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,670
Third, that the right to self taxation is the distinguishing characteristic of British

203
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,160
freedom. Fourth, that this is exactly how things have operated in Virginia since the

204
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,330
founding of the colony.

205
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,750
So and I'll quote the big finale in full.

206
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,590
Resolved, therefore, that the General Assembly of this colony have the only an exclusive

207
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,630
right and power to lay taxes and impositions upon the inhabitants of this colony, and

208
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:55,210
that every attempt to vest such power in any person or persons whatsoever other than the

209
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:01,270
General Assembly aforesaid as a manifest tendency to destroy British as well as American

210
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:08,440
freedom. Now, although the fifth resolve followed logically from the first four, it was

211
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,590
too radical for the House of Burgesses and a conservative opposition rally back.

212
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,200
The next day and overturned it.

213
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,630
But the first four resolved remained officially on the books and the fifth one leaked out

214
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,170
to the rest of the colonies by unofficial reports and correspondence.

215
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,510
The Virginia resolves circulated through the colonies over the summer, and most of the

216
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,990
other colonial assemblies began to pass similar declarations.

217
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,720
Meanwhile, up in Massachusetts, events took a far more extreme turn.

218
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,310
And we will find our first injection of mob violence into the dispute.

219
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,430
As I said, the way the Stamp Act crisis unfolded in each colony was often driven by

220
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,860
political divisions unique to each colony.

221
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,690
And this was clearly the case in Massachusetts, where the flames were fanned by a long

222
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,640
standing rivalry between Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson and the on-again off-again

223
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,910
political alliance of Radic Attorney James Otis Jr.

224
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,020
and soon to be professional agitator Samuel Adams.

225
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,580
Beginning back in 1764, Adams and his friends began to form committees of correspondence

226
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,470
throughout Massachusetts, whose job it would be to share information and ideas and

227
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,920
responses amongst the various towns adjacent to and overlapping with these committees

228
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,050
were semi clandestine organizations of artisans, shopkeepers and traders.

229
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,890
That soon consolidated into the famous sons of Liberty.

230
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,080
So when official news of the stamp pack hit, along with the news that the hated

231
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,640
Hutchison's brother in law, Andrew Oliver, had been named stamp distributor, the

232
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,800
burgeoning populist machine went to work.

233
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,430
They were not going to take this lying down.

234
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:59,470
By the middle of August, 1765, the time for plotting was over and the time for action was

235
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:05,350
at hand, marshalling the loosely organized mobs of Boston to provide the shock troops.

236
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,480
The radical opponents of the Stamp Act hung an effigy of Andrew Oliver in Boston on

237
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,810
August the 14th when the sheriff came to take it down.

238
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,790
He took one look at the size and disposition of the mob and said, Forget it, I'm out of

239
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:24,640
here. As darkness fell, the mob moved to some offices located on a dock that they

240
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,060
believed Oliver was planning to use as the stamp distribution hub.

241
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,400
And they smashed the offices to bits.

242
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,010
Then they moved on to Oliver's home.

243
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,860
When they got there, they beheaded the effigy, ritually stamped it into the ground.

244
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,360
Get it? Stamp Act.

245
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,670
These guys were not without a sense of humor.

246
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,890
And then they pushed their way into Oliver's home and smashed the place up all over

247
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,020
himself. Of course, had been warned to stay away.

248
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,990
The mob did its work and then retired.

249
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,550
The next day, a small delegation met with Oliver and suggested that he resign his

250
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,510
commission, and Oliver agreed that yes, I think that would be for the best.

251
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,990
But that was not the end of it.

252
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,880
On August the twenty sixth, the mobs reconvened with the intention of smashing up the

253
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,220
homes of other alleged supporters of the Stamp Act.

254
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,320
One of those houses was actually only being rented by the intended target, and when the

255
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,430
mob arrived, they found the much distressed owner begging them to leave the house alone.

256
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,590
As a show of good faith, he provided free beer for everyone.

257
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,560
So now, good and drunk, the mob moved on to the big finale, the home of the hated Thomas

258
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,600
Hutchinson, a home that, by all accounts, was the largest and grandest in Massachusetts.

259
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,250
The mob broke in and methodically destroyed everything.

260
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,180
But though this all seems like the work of out-of-control drunks, it was in fact highly

261
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,740
organized and all things considered, highly disciplined and the destruction did not

262
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,900
spread beyond the specified targets.

263
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,740
So here we have two of the most important colonies, Virginia and Massachusetts, taking

264
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,480
the lead in strenuously opposing a law that wasn't even technically to go in effect until

265
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,500
November the first.

266
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,530
Clearly, there had been some kind of political miscalculation back in England.

267
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,160
But if anyone wanted to blame Grenville, it was already too late because in July he was

268
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,420
forced out of the ministry not so much because of his colonial policies, but because of

269
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,850
infighting within and around the royal family.

270
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,690
He was succeeded by Lord Rockingham, who entered office in July 1765 and immediately

271
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,350
started looking for ways to get out from under his predecessor's colonial policies.

272
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,900
But it was not going to be as easy as simply repealing the Stamp Act, especially after

273
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,450
reports of the riots in Boston started filtering in.

274
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:49,340
Because you can't simply let a mob dictate policy and you certainly can't let the

275
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,750
colonists walk away thinking parliament has no right to tax them.

276
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,700
As Rockingham is weak and divided, ministry groped for a solution.

277
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:05,120
Colonial anger continued as high minded rhetorical appeals were joined by one, let's call

278
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,820
them less high minded mob demonstrations.

279
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,400
It all culminated in October.

280
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,060
What we now call the Stamp Act Congress, the Massachusetts legislature had sent out a

281
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,580
circular letter calling for a Pan Colonial Assembly to discuss a coordinated response to

282
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,530
both the sugar and stamp acts.

283
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,350
In the end, nine colonies sent delegates to meet in New York City from Massachusetts,

284
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:36,950
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and

285
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,500
South Carolina. Virginia and Georgia would have almost certainly been among them, but

286
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,970
their colonial governors had refused to allow their respective assemblies to convene in

287
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,290
order to select delegates.

288
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,750
The Stepback Congress met on October the 7th, and over the course of their deliberations,

289
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,370
they started discussing an idea that will help define the next round of the fight between

290
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,660
Britain and her colonies.

291
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,190
The distinction between internal and external taxation.

292
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,810
The theory was that parliament had no right to levy direct taxes for the purposes of

293
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:17,060
raising revenue. Levying those sorts of internal taxes were the sole right of the

294
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,080
colonial assemblies.

295
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,090
But the delegates were willing to grant the parliament have the right to levy external

296
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,700
taxes for the purposes of regulating trade.

297
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,750
Both the Sugar Act and Stamp Act would be classified as internal taxes because both were

298
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,860
explicitly designed to raise revenue, not regulate trade.

299
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,100
This distinction was a nice formulation that would work for the present crisis.

300
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,600
But as we will see next week when Charles Townsend devises a way to test the theory

301
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,500
proved to be a distinction that no one really recognized.

302
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,540
The Stamp Act Congress concluded by drafting a fourteen point Declaration of Rights and

303
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,070
grievances, which opened by stating that the colonists owed Parliament all due

304
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,140
subordination, but that they possess the same rights as any Englishman and that direct

305
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,990
taxes could only be levied by the colonial assemblies.

306
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,630
It was a remarkable bit of unity from a group of colonies that under normal circumstances

307
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,960
would have agreed only that they disagreed about everything.

308
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,160
The stamp that Congress broke up on October the 25th, 1765, just as the Stamp Act itself

309
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,570
was about to take effect.

310
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,390
Meanwhile, just down the street, a group of merchants in New York City got together and

311
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,670
agreed to a limited non importation agreement that was to endure as long as the Stamp Act

312
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,950
was in effect. This idea soon spread to other colonies, and merchant groups in the major

313
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,450
cities agreed not to bring in any British goods until the Stamp Act was repealed.

314
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,630
But by this point, the non importation movement was probably unnecessary as the ministry

315
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,540
was already looking for ways to get out from under the Stamp Act.

316
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,310
But it did provide a first round of practical experience for the merchants because as we

317
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:09,620
will see down the road, not importation will become a major component of colonial

318
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:15,650
resistance. So by the time November the 1st finally came around, the Stamp Act was dead

319
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,960
on arrival. Practically every single stamp distributor had been confronted and either

320
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,660
resigned or agreed not to distribute the stamp paper when Parliament reconvened in

321
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,710
December. It was already of a mind to do away with this troublesome act.

322
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,080
But the big question remained unanswered.

323
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,670
How do you repeal the Stamp Act without letting the colonists think that they can avoid

324
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,360
parliamentary control simply by throwing a collective temper tantrum?

325
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,400
Because while most M.P.s

326
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,370
agreed of the Stamp Act itself was counterproductive.

327
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,480
They uniformly believed that parliament had the right to run the colonies however they

328
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,080
saw fit, and on that principle they would not be moved.

329
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,530
As parliament debated the question, the Americans suddenly won a powerful ally in the

330
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,980
Commons. Former Prime Minister William Pitt.

331
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,730
Though he was on the back end of his life and career.

332
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,130
The charismatic Pitt still had a spark and he launched a fierce denunciation of the

333
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,310
ministry and openly praised colonial resistance.

334
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,680
This led to a famous exchange with George Grenville, who still sat as an MP.

335
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,300
The incredulous Grenville asked Pitt, when was it exactly that the colonists had been

336
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,550
emancipated from parliamentary control?

337
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,080
To which Pitt replied.

338
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:36,650
Well, when is it exactly that we made them slaves in the midst of this debate?

339
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,180
Parliament called an influential American agent to testify as to the mood of his

340
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,100
countrymen with regard to the Stamp Act.

341
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,620
None other than Benjamin Franklin.

342
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:52,610
Franklin was easily the most famous and most respected American pretty much ever, and he

343
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,850
was basically the first colonial that Europeans took seriously.

344
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,130
He has often been called the first American, and I sometimes like to call him the

345
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:06,200
founding grandfather as he was a generation older than the men who will become known as

346
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,250
the Founding Fathers.

347
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,850
Born in 1786, Franklin skipped out on a printing apprenticeship to an elder brother at

348
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,390
the age of 17, started over from scratch in Philadelphia.

349
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,850
And through wit, guile and hard work soon established himself as the leading printer in

350
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,190
the city, achieving his greatest success.

351
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,730
The annual publication of Poor Richard's Almanac, which debuted in 1733.

352
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,670
But Franklin was merely a printer by trade, by passion.

353
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,170
He was an intensely curious polymath who was interested in everything.

354
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,790
A passion that eventually led him to famously dabble in electricity.

355
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,100
He soon not only proved that lightning was in fact made of electricity, but ever driven

356
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,780
by his practical sensibilities.

357
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,290
He invented these lightning rod to protect houses from strikes.

358
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,180
It was his scientific work that earned him the attention of Europe.

359
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,620
Now, it would take 20 episodes to run through the endlessly fascinating life of the good

360
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,040
Doctor Franklin. For our purposes, we should skip ahead.

361
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,750
Who 1757?

362
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,840
When Pennsylvania appointed him to serve as their agent in London, at that point,

363
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,440
Franklin moved to England and pretty much lived there continuously until the outbreak of

364
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,870
the revolution. By the time of the Stamp Act crisis, Franklin was also officially

365
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,330
representing both Georgia and Massachusetts.

366
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,250
And when he was called before Parliament, he reiterated the distinction between internal

367
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,080
and external taxation, neatly dancing around the few probing m.p.'s

368
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,160
who tried to trip him up.

369
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:47,230
But for the most part, his testimony was arranged by friends in Parliament who very much

370
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,990
wanted to ditch the Stamp Act and were looking for an excuse to do so through February.

371
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,200
The debate raged on until finally a solution was hit upon.

372
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,750
The Stamp Act would be repealed.

373
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,730
But along with it, Parliament would issue what has become known as the Declaratory Act,

374
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:09,220
which stated that Parliament had the power and authority to make laws and statutes of

375
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,950
sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of America in all cases

376
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,220
whatsoever. In other words, we're giving into your immediate demands, but we are not

377
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,720
conceding the broader point.

378
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,910
Not even a little bit.

379
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,610
In all cases whatsoever.

380
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,320
But though the more savvy colonial leaders could see the dangers posed by the Declaratory

381
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,880
Act when news hit the colonies in May that the Stamp Act had been repealed, it kicked off

382
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,180
a wave of celebrations, bonfires, merrymaking and heavy drinking from New Hampshire to

383
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:51,620
Georgia. In the first round of the fight, the colonists had won, but that declaratory act

384
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,070
clearly signalled that parliament would soon be back for more.

385
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,280
The fight over the Stamp Act very nearly broke.

386
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,540
The revolutionary wave a decade earlier than it finally did.

387
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,870
The pattern of colonial assemblies issuing strong resolutions, organized mobs targeting

388
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:15,360
enemies of liberty, merchants forming non importation pacts, all culminating with a pan

389
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,030
colonial alliance to organize collective resistance.

390
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,440
Well, this is all going to get replayed in the 1770s, though.

391
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,060
By that point, the British will be done backing down and the Revolutionary War will

392
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,350
finally break out. But that is still a ways down the road.

393
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,610
And as I also noted, it was not at all inevitable that that Revolutionary War should

394
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:41,310
break out. But next week, we will get into round two of the fight as Lord of the

395
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,870
Treasury, Charles Townsend will test the proposition that the colonists did not object to

396
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,240
taxes merely designed to regulate trade.

397
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,280
Spoiler alert. Turns out they were just saying.
